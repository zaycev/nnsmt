they include a framework programme which aims to strengthen the relevant chinese administrative structures and capacities through a series of specialised modules targeting segments in the chinese administration which will be dealing with wto implementation .
other programmes are geared towards helping china to implement specific wto obligations .
we are currently considering how best to build on these , and new initiatives will be taken .
clearly , close coordination is going to be essential in order to avoid overlaps and to develop synergies between different programmes which each donor will implement in accordance with its own procedures .
the need for coordination will be especially strong where assistance is targeted at the implementation of specific wto agreements , and we will support close involvement of the wto in these areas .
as regards the question of coordination with the united states , we will certainly look very carefully at our options .
we have to bear in mind that this will have some effects on the visibility of our european efforts .
i just want to repeat that this is an extremely important issue ; it is an issue on which commissioner lamy and i have already begun discussions .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , china was yet another of our trading partners to realise during negotiations in beijing that the european union has specific , independent weight as a major global trading area .
the commission represented coherent positions on the part of the european union with the support of the european parliament and the council of ministers and implemented many of them .
competition and the reciprocal opening of markets , freedom of establishment and in the provision of services , intellectual property rights , environmental protection and partnership for sustainable development are just a few examples .
there is no need to outline the specific successes in detail .
so the results are clear .
but integrating china into world trade also means ensuring that it is in a position to respect and apply the rules of the world trade organisation , act as a responsible partner and take on new responsibilities .
we therefore thank commissioner patten for his assurance that technical assistance , training for china ' s specialists and for those responsible for the new chapter in cooperation will be coordinated with the united states .
but we feel that something else is needed ; greater understanding on china ' s part of the european union ' s commercial position on the reciprocal opening of the markets .
we are counting on china ' s supporting the european union ' s proposals for a comprehensive new round of wto talks in the short term .
in the long term , we would stress the implications of a more intensive trading partnership with china for peace in asia , europe and the world as a whole .
we feel that china will , in the long term , see the obvious need for the rapid economic and social development of china to be fostered within a framework of open markets and democratic reform .
mr president , mr president-in-office , commissioner patten , ladies and gentlemen , my fellow members have already picked up on the main points .
permit me , therefore , to address just a few aspects .
the european union has achieved a number of successes , mainly thanks to commissioner lamy , who really has achieved some resounding successes .
but this also applies of course to the united states , and the same will apply to the other countries due to enter into negotiations .
will it mark the beginning of a further opening of society ?
will it mark the beginning of a new round in politics ?
will it result in institutional reforms in china ?
and , of course , will there also be a further opening of the market ?
these are the really crucial and exciting questions which we face .
however , we must not fool ourselves , we must not harbour any illusions , and we must insist that the wto rules are in fact upheld , because this is , of course , the crux of the matter .
this is where we really will have to get down to brass tacks during further discussions with the commission .
because the package negotiated is extremely comprehensive and includes highly critical and sensitive sectors .
critical voices are already being heard on the part of industry to the effect that success is all well and good , but ex-post control of implementation is equally important .
i think that we will be able to count on good collaboration here , so that this form of implementation can be monitored by parliament and parliament can be kept abreast of current developments .
human rights are a fundamental element of a modern society .
i think that this a point which we cannot allow to be sidelined , even in talks , even if they do not form a substantial part of purely economic negotiations .
i think that you have always set particular store by this .
nonetheless , it is important that this point be reiterated constantly .
mr president , i have two short minutes in which to make four points .
firstly i would like to join in the warm congratulations to commissioner lamy and indeed his distinguished predecessor sir leon , now lord , brittan .
i hope the brevity of my congratulations does not diminish the warmth of them .
secondly , a point addressed to the council .
this simply cannot carry on .
it is such a weird anachronism that a policy that was communautarised back in the 1950s is as unaccountable and non-transparent as it is .
i would plead for the internal territorial interests of member states to be overcome on this particular point .
thirdly , technical assistance .
it is great that we are going to coordinate with the americans , but look at the numbers : eur 25 million is absolutely nothing in comparison to the challenge we face !
we have a total budget for china of eur 80 million .
even if we allocate all of that to china-wto accession it would still not be enough .
we - the commission , council and parliament - have to be a lot more ambitious in actually allocating much more money towards this enormous task .
finally , human rights .
i hope the fact that we have signed up to this bilateral deal with the chinese does not leave them thinking that we are going to be any more forgiving on human rights .
it is all the more important that all three institutions should now be particularly robust about the way the chinese behave in the so-called dialogue on human rights .
let us not give them the impression that a deal on the wto means that we are going to be weak on human rights - it should be the reverse .
we should be all the more robust .
mr president , if the preceding speakers are to be believed , we now have paradise in view . the chinese , in particular , are heading there and nowhere else .
i was reading an interview in china labour bulletin the other day about one of the tens of millions of chinese who have become unemployed because of the famous ' opening up ' of their country .
this person was complaining about the unemployment , insecurity and enormous widening of the gulf between the classes .
in fact , this chinese person was so desperate that she said she wished mao tse tung was back .
from all the analyses i have read , which is quite a lot ( both chinese and western , liberal and socialist ) , it is apparent that unemployment is coming to china .
it has already increased a great deal and , through accession to the wto , it is going to increase a very great deal more .
i am wondering now if the commission has carried out any other analyses .
it would be extremely interesting to know .
another matter is that of human rights .
a number of people here believe that human rights should benefit from china ' s accession to the wto .
yes , that is possible - i am no fortune-teller .
parliament did , however , give the sakharov prize to wei jingsheng , who has a quite different view of this issue .
his assessment is that the wto agreement will not benefit human rights at all .
he has actively fought against it because he thinks that it does not make reasonable demands where human rights are concerned .
it would be extremely interesting to know what are the commission ' s and the council ' s analyses of this question .
in what way is wei jingsheng mistaken ?
we should like to know that we are not doing anything which , contrary to our intentions , is unfavourable to human rights .
mr president , commissioner , minister , it is not pleasant to play the role of someone who repeatedly asks the same questions .
it is not , however , my fault , commissioner , if there is a wishy-washy consensus in this parliament .
now , what has happened since that abortive summit ?
therefore , we have the right to ask a few questions .
what purpose do the wto meetings serve if there is no difference between failure and success in the way internal business is conducted ?
furthermore , are you able to tell us how the european union and its partners categorise china ? do you class it as a developing country or as something else ?
how do you see the astonishing upheaval in the balance within the organisation that uses this kind of approach to the situation ?
i must say that it looks like we would not be able to undertake any action that might give the impression that doubts exist as to the benefits of liberalising world trade .
mr president , i , too , would like to congratulate commissioner lamy on securing such improved terms and a deal with china .
after such a long history of negotiations clearly all that was needed was the question from our committee to push the matter to a conclusion .
recently i was visiting taiwan where people clearly hope that the accession of china to the wto will lead to improved cross-strait relations , and we must welcome that .
i would have referred to commissioner patten knowing well the difficulties of dealing and negotiating with china , but he has already mentioned that .
the prospect of a change in the duty on spirits from 65 % to 10 % will be a most welcome one in certain parts of the whisky-producing areas of the uk .
i look forward to sharing that news with them in liberal and liquid fashion .
on a larger scale the position achieved in access to , and faster opening up of , the telecoms market is also good news .
china has such huge potential in this market for growth , and european operators have a great opportunity as world leaders looking for new markets .
i welcome this step in the further integration of china into the world economy but we must recall the emphasis that we , in the european union , place upon other values in addition to trade .
in that context i would like to call , on behalf of my british conservative colleagues , for european parliament participation in the half-yearly dialogue on human rights .
if this parliament were part of that dialogue we might exert additional pressure for improvement in that field .
i hope the commissioner will listen carefully to that suggestion .
mr president , while international big business is busy popping champagne corks in celebration of the agreement on china 's proposed accession to the wto , china 's small-scale farmers are already quaking in their shoes .
they know that accession to the wto will be a very mixed blessing for china and that for them , as small farmers , it could spell ruin .
so i beg to differ with commissioner patten .
there are many people in china for whom this agreement does not spell good news .
powerful international agri-business knows that too .
that is why us grain companies like cargill cannot believe their luck .
but while cargill is so delighted that its profits will rise while chinese self-sufficiency in agricultural goods falls , the picture is a good deal less optimistic for the people of china themselves .
it has been estimated that increased competition from cheap agricultural imports could mean that about 400 million rural chinese will no longer be needed on farms by 2005 .
it is almost impossible to conceive of such a huge figure or to think about the social dislocation and misery that will cause .
the commission is offering technical support to the chinese in order to help them with the enormous economic restructuring which accession to the wto will bring .
what i would like to see is an equal concern to help with the almost inconceivable social restructuring which will inevitably follow in its wake with - i repeat - 400 million rural farmers out of a job .
mr lamy has been quoted as saying that the bilateral negotiations between the eu and china yielded 96 % of what the eu was demanding .
would he like to estimate what percentage of success the chinese people will get from these same negotiations ?
mr president , representatives of the commission and the council , the volume of world trade has soared in recent decades .
despite the giant leaps forward , many problems remain unresolved and questions left open with regard to world trade .
one of the biggest and politically most difficult of these has been china ' s accession to the wto , and this same problem will again be associated with the implementation of the agreement in practice .
as this is a matter of the world ' s second largest economy and eleventh largest exporting country joining the most important institutional system for world trade , the importance of the issue cannot be emphasised too heavily .
i agree with mr clegg as regards the impression one gets that the commission and the council have perhaps been rather too keen in this matter to refer to the treaty of amsterdam and hide behind formal requirements .
the fact that the talks on accession will not lead to changing the legal framework does not lessen the importance of the issue .
for that reason , an informal dialogue free from the exact wording of the basic agreement , which the commissioner mentioned in his speech , is more crucial than ever before .
it is in the interests of the european union as a whole to support china in the reform of its economy , administration and legal system .
it is sensible to implement the technical assistance package from the eu and the united states in a context of collaboration ; this is necessary to guarantee the speedy and single-minded implementation of the reforms .
of the reforms in the public sector , that concerning state-owned companies is vital for continued economic growth in china .
in this connection i will make my sole comment regarding content : the percentage of ownership by foreign companies was not fixed at the level the eu was aiming at .
that was a very bad mistake .
another important political question is how the economic life of the country is to be reformed , as that is closely linked with the fate of china ' s socialist system as a whole .
the debate is closed .
mr president , on a point of order , when i inquired this morning about the time of this debate i was told it would start shortly after 3 o 'clock .
when i came for this debate at 3 o 'clock i was told it would be taking place later , towards 5 o 'clock .
clearly there is pressure on our agenda today .
i wish to put forward a proposal that might relieve pressure on the end of today 's agenda , namely , the debate previewed for the late payments directive - the report of the conciliation procedure with the council .
this is an issue which is now entirely without contention .
everybody supports this matter .
the rapporteur , the shadow rapporteur and the chairman of the committee would all support a suggestion that this be turned into a vote without debate .
that would end pressure on the agenda right at the end of this evening .
possibly we could have a vote on it now .
mr chichester , i do not feel in a position to make a decision , not even with recourse to the rules of procedure or the advice of officials .
but we take very good note of this proposal .
question time ( council )
the next item is question time ( b5-0487 / 2000 ) .
we will examine questions to the council .
question no 1 by ( h-0434 / 00 ) :
subject : increase in community budgetary resources much time has been devoted so far at the intergovernmental conference to issues such as the need to revise the decision-taking procedure in the council of ministers and the number of commissioners .
how does the council view the prospect of a substantive increase in community budgetary resources , what could be the ' ceiling ' of such an increase and how realistic is such an objective under present conditions ?
however , the current context is not favourable to increasing the budget , as was demonstrated in the agenda 2000 negotiations , and this is not the right moment to reopen this debate .
the council currently considers that there is no need to revise the financial perspectives .
also , can the council reassure the people in the poor countries of the european union that enlargement will not result in budgetary cutbacks ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
mr president , i understand the member ' s concern and realise that this is shared by several sectors in the eu .
the truth is that the changes which have been made to the funding allocation plan , particularly in the last year , have not affected the union ' s compliance with its undertakings in these areas .
these changes have also been made based on appropriations that remain unspent in certain areas .
in this way , some of the expenditure arising from enlargement , if this takes place in the meantime , may be covered .
however , given that we are currently in the first year of implementing the financial perspectives , there is no reason at the moment to justify any reassessment of the commitment made in berlin .
the committee on budgets and the european parliament agreed in the end in agenda 2000 to reduce the 1.27 % proportion of gdp by 2006 .
the citizens of europe want a thrifty administration and the purpose of the concept of real stabilisation is to achieve a further net improvement in the quality of the work of the council and the commission .
it should enable us to work even more efficiently in the future in the european union .
do you believe that the concept of real stabilisation can be continued after 2006 ?
i am very happy to answer the honourable member ' s question .
i was involved in the agenda 2000 negotiations and i clearly recall the concept of real stabilisation which was proposed . in practice this meant reducing the amounts established .
this is my personal view .
as the author is not present , question no 2 lapses .
question no 3 by ( h-0446 / 00 ) :
mr president , negotiations within the ospar commission on issues coming under the community competence are conducted , as you know , by the commission in consultation with a committee of representatives of the member states .
the council would analyse this proposal with due care .
the position mentioned by the member has not been presented to date to the council and we cannot , therefore , comment on this matter .
i know that the portuguese presidency is very familiar with this issue .
as you know , the ospar commission met in sintra two years ago and some progress was made on pollution of the marine environment .
my question pertains particularly to radioactive emissions .
i know france is part of the troika and will be taking up the presidency in july .
is the council aware of this study ?
would it like more information about this study ?
will it bring it to the attention of the french presidency ?
on the one hand they claim to be controlling radioactive pollution to the marine environment , but on the other hand we have proof that there is radioactive pollution , so there is some contradiction there .
the council needs to get its act together .
i take the point about the commission 's proposals and i look forward to discussing this further with the commission when we have a result from copenhagen .
neither ireland nor denmark have so far sent the council any proposals on radioactive waste .
given that the council as such is not a member of the ospar commission , only the european commission can adopt a legislative measure in this respect .
therefore , any information which may be received in this respect by the council will be welcome .
question no 4 by ( h-0449 / 00 ) :
in which member states is religion one of the items recorded on citizens ' identity cards ?
mr president , the council has never been asked to discuss the issue raised by the honourable member .
as i said , no proposal has been presented to the council on this issue .
in any case we are talking about actions by free and democratic countries .
in order to challenge a measure of this type , a specific legal framework for complaints exists at national level .
clearly , the community bodies can be appealed to following action before these national bodies .
i should like to thank the president-in-office for his reply .
yesterday i tabled the same question to the european commission . i received its reply today .
however , there is some confusion in the matter which , as far as greece is concerned , is an extremely important matter .
i thank the president-in-office , although i noticed that he contradicted himself in his reply .
on the one hand he says that it is not a community matter , it is a matter for the member state .
on the other hand , however , he raises the question of compliance with the law .
the president-in-office obviously has in mind the reply which the commission gave on precisely this issue , which says that a reference to religion infringes directive 46 / 95 on personal data .
does the president-in-office agree with this reply , if that is what he has in mind ?
or does he not have it in mind , which would demonstrate a huge lack of coordination between the council and the commission on a very important issue ?
mr alavanos , there is no contradiction in this respect and the problem is very simple .
as this issue is not covered by a community provision , it is solely a question of greek national policy and is subject to greek law .
clearly , this situation will only change if a community provision is transposed into greek law and therefore itself becomes a greek law .
the problem lies in determining whether or not , at this stage of the process , this reference constitutes an infringement of community law .
only the commission would have the authority to act in this respect .
as it has not acted so far , this means that this is not currently a community issue .
therefore , at this stage , this issue does not have a community dimension .
if this situation changes , the commission will then be able to take the appropriate decisions , particularly in conjunction with the court of justice .
the president-in-office ' s reply is correct .
there are no plans to intervene , it is a matter for national law and that is what greece has been practising up to now .
the principle introduced for personal data resulted in a decision whereby the reference to a person ' s religion was an infringement of personal data .
however , i know for a fact that the community directive on this issue states that , if the person in question agrees to a reference to their religion , then it is not prohibited to include such personal data .
and that is precisely what our party and the greek church want : a voluntary reference .
whoever wants to , can state their religion , and whoever does not want to , need not do so .
i would like to remind you that this question time is for questions to the council .
it can in no way be used to explain the positions of governments or the sensibilities of certain countries .
question no 5 by ( h-0450 / 00 ) :
in addition , it has made accusations concerning development and environmental activities by greece in the areas in question , many of which are funded by relevant european union programmes .
to be specific , in its representations to the greek government on wednesday , 10 may 2000 turkey referred to ' military and other activities by greece on geographical formations of disputed sovereignty in the aegean ' .
mr president , the council does not have any information , rumours aside , on any representations made by turkey to the greek government on 10 may 2000 .
as the honourable member mentioned , the helsinki european council recognised turkey as an applicant country .
at this same european council , the applicant countries were also urged to make every effort to resolve all existing border disputes and other similar issues .
unresolved disputes must be brought before the international court of justice within a reasonable period of time or at the latest by 2004 .
the council will then re-examine the situation .
with regard to relations between greece and turkey , which form the basis of this whole issue , the council can only welcome an improvement in these relations .
it is hoped that this positive process will continue so that the issues relating to the aegean are successfully resolved in accordance with international law .
it should be recalled in this respect , as this is also extremely positive , that turkish troops participated in the nato exercise which took place in part on greek territory .
turkish troops have never before participated in exercises on greek territory .
minister , i too am personally in favour of closer relations between greece and turkey , but subject to certain specific conditions .
obviously it sees it as an unnecessary luxury .
it feels that turkey can proceed unimpeded on its path towards the european union , violating greek sovereignty all the while .
but that is a matter for the greek government .
mr hatzidakis , in my opinion helsinki represented a moment of great balance in terms of the concerns of those involved , namely greece , turkey and also cyprus as a third party .
the decision taken to recognise turkey as an applicant country was made in view of this overall balance .
a timetable was also set for this which is indissociably linked to turkey ' s ambitions for its accession to the european union .
we must realise instead that it is essential to reduce these tensions . it is particularly important that we use the time factor .
mr president-in-office , i should like to be a little more specific .
for greece , as far as turkey is concerned , there is only one issue which needs to be settled and that is the boundaries of the continental shelf in the aegean .
turkey has disputed a number of issues in the aegean at one time or another .
and one of these issues is the status of the grey zones or island rocks in the aegean .
what is the council ' s opinion ; is this what it is calling on turkey to do ?
to settle as a border dispute the status of the aegean , where greece does not acknowledge that there is an issue ?
mr theonas , these issues are part of the dispute between greece and turkey .
conversations and negotiations are now occurring in this respect and bilateral contacts are being made , accompanied by confidence-building measures .
we should allow some time for this process to develop before becoming involved in any potential conflicts .
we know that this is not the case and that we all have different ideas about the same subject .
this is also true of greece and turkey but there is now a negotiating framework for this .
we must bide our time and ensure that this negotiating framework can operate , particularly bearing in mind the currently positive greek-turkish relations .
question no 6 by ( h-0451 / 00 ) :
subject : political intervention in georgia 's problems georgia , the newly independent state , is encountering serious difficulties in consolidating democracy and raising its citizens ' standards of living .
its attempts are being hindered by the problem of the breakaway of south ossetia and abkhazia and the wave of refugees mainly taken in by abkhazia .
in its resolutions , parliament has condemned this situation and has asked the commission and the council to support the council of europe ' s initiative to set up confidence-building measures in the area .
does the council have any strategy for this sensitive region ?
does it intend to operate a policy designed to safeguard peace and security in the region ?
mr president , the council is clearly concerned about the internal conflicts in georgia which still need to be resolved .
it is also concerned about the difficulties which are being experienced in terms of consolidating democracy and improving the standard of living of the people of that country .
we are therefore giving political and economic support within the partnership and cooperation agreement which entered into force on 1 july 1999 .
this same resolution indicated the importance of developing regional cooperation , establishing friendly relations between the countries and sustainably developing their economies .
moreover , the european union indicated that it was ready to use its support instruments in order to create a suitable environment for resolving conflicts in the caucasus .
moreover , the eu has also been giving assistance to almost 300 000 displaced persons within georgia who were forced to abandon their homes due to the conflict .
the eu is encouraging the resolution of this conflict so that these people can return to their homes as quickly as possible and is ready to offer additional assistance in this event .
the war in neighbouring chechnya represents an additional threat to georgia .
the council fears that this conflict may spread to georgia and welcomes the extension of the osce ' s monitoring mission along the respective borders .
at the request of president shevardnadze , the european union is now studying possible ways of helping to reinforce and ensure the efficacy of this monitoring mission .
thank you , mr president-in-office , for the information which you have given me .
the problem of refugees , which include many georgian citizens of greek descent , has not been solved .
and i should like to ask you what additional measures you feel need to be taken and extended , as you have just said ?
and one more question : do you believe that the conflict to which you referred is part of russian policy in this region ?
also , has the council taken account of this possibility in its policy in the region ?
mrs kratsa-tsagaropoulou , with regard to the measures which the european union can adopt in this area , i can only point to the plan mentioned and the set of initiatives which the eu has introduced on the ground .
however , given the strategic importance of the area , the european union has been doing whatever it considers possible in this respect .
i agree that other measures may be possible but there is not currently a framework of financing which would allow us to go further , particularly in terms of acting to reinforce the infrastructures .
question no 7 by ( h-0454 / 00 ) :
the council has on several occasions discussed the fundamentalist violence and assassinations carried out against the coptic community in upper egypt .
we are continuing to closely monitor this situation .
the negotiations on the association agreement with egypt were concluded last year and it is envisaged that this will shortly be signed .
this will naturally form the backdrop to the bilateral relations and political dialogue which are integral to this agreement .
i wish to thank the president-in-office for his reply .
i would say this question was prompted by the very large number of letters i receive from constituents about this particular issue .
it is perhaps the issue i have received more letters about in the last year than any other .
it strikes me from what he said that it is very strange that after several of the coptic christians had been attacked and disturbed by the others , that it was only coptic christians who were arrested .
the president-in-office said in his reply that the council will remind the egyptians of their responsibilities and wait until they have signed the association agreement and can bring an institutionalised political dialogue to bear .
but why does he not use the signing of this agreement as a basis on which to force the egyptians to come to a more equable , reasonable and non-discriminatory approach to their coptic christian citizens ?
this issue has been addressed in the bilateral political dialogue and has naturally been raised within the normal framework of relations between the european union and third countries .
however , the european union will continue to carefully monitor this problem and will certainly raise this issue with the egyptian authorities regardless of whether the agreement has been signed .
mr president , i was in egypt at exactly the time when these events took place .
i saw that the situation was serious , but that , as you said , the egyptian authorities were making a huge effort .
i can only agree with the honourable member when he says that there are situations in other countries in the southern mediterranean which seem more serious than this issue .
it is practically impossible for the european union to constantly monitor all situations in all the countries with which we have a relationship within the euro-mediterranean partnership .
we cannot expect the european union to operate as a kind of international human rights monitor .
there are other specific institutions to do this work .
however , we will ensure that the due consequences are felt in our bilateral political relations with regard to any negative development in these respects .
i also agree that there are much worse situations in other countries within the barcelona process , some of which perhaps do not occur to us when we are speaking , which must also be duly assessed .
however , the european union cannot be expected to do the work of the international institutions in this area .
question no 8 by ( h-0457 / 00 ) :
subject : significance of euro-11 will the council say on what issues euro-11 has , since coming into existence , taken decisions that have been of political significance to the european union and its member states ?
mr president , euro 11 must be one of the biggest mysteries within the community institutions because this question comes up on a regular basis .
the third phase of economic and monetary union saw the beginning of informal meetings of the euro council or euro 11 as it also known . this brings together the finance ministers of the countries in the euro zone .
these meetings are held monthly and before the formal meetings of ecofin which involve all fifteen member states .
euro 11 meetings essentially address issues relating to the specific responsibilities which the eleven countries share in matters involving the single currency .
whenever the issues go beyond this scope , the meetings are extended to all the member states as is laid down .
in all cases where decisions must be taken , ecofin takes these in accordance with the procedures established in the treaty .
this was the guidance given by the luxembourg european council of 12 and 13 december 1997 .
the issues discussed by euro 11 and transferred subsequently to ecofin , which is attended by all the other countries which have not adopted the euro , are widely known , even in the press .
mr president , i should like to thank the presidency for its answer to my question .
the fact is that , in those countries which are to decide whether or not to join the common currency , such as sweden and denmark , there are discussions taking place about the significance of euro-11 .
i think it is important that the presidency should again state that euro-11 has no formal right of decision-making whatsoever .
the question , however , is that of whether any individual questions in the informal euro-11 discussions can be pointed to which have subsequently led to formal decisions in ecofin .
i wonder if the council of ministers can provide examples of any such concrete questions from the discussion in euro-11 which have led to a new policy ' s having been created .
there are currently no elements of policy coordination between the countries in euro 11 which naturally affect or should affect their behaviour in ecofin .
this point is important for understanding that perhaps in the future , when different policy integration models exist , we will see more elements and more ways of working of this kind .
this may be the future and we will see whether the feira european council integrates closer cooperation into the intergovernmental conference .
if so , we will very probably see several models emerge .
how can we avoid this ?
for a country such as the honourable member ' s perhaps the problem will be solved by being part of the euro council .
however , until this decision is taken by the authorities in his country , the euro council will consist exclusively of the eleven countries which have actually adopted the euro .
i think i heard the president-in-office of the council say something along the lines that there were agendas for these informal meetings and that these agendas were to be publicly available .
i have never seen any such agenda , and i should like to ask the president-in-office of the council to state clearly to what extent agendas are available in advance of the meetings .
the reason why both swedish and danish meps are raising these questions is that we have obtained the impression that the euro 11 is an influential body .
however , i understand from the answer of the president-in-office of the council that formal authority and the power to make decisions of a legal and political nature still lie with ecofin .
we must be clear on this , mr krarup . issues relating to the single currency are addressed jointly but solely by the eleven members of euro 11 .
it is as simple as that .
it is natural that there is prior coordination between these countries and it is natural that this coordination ends up having some influence on the final decision taken in ecofin .
this happens at contact group level and in the relations between various countries in various contexts .
you will say that this is not part of the normal procedure .
that is true in that case but in the case of euro 11 this is institutionalised in the treaty and it is this which is specified .
there should be no doubt on this .
is there a procedural expectation that all eleven will vote the same way in the formal decision-making in ecofin ?
mr newton dunn , all i can say is that the ministers are responsible for their own positions .
therefore , if at the euro 11 meeting they have different opinions but the discussion leads them to a joint conclusion i do not see why this same position should not be taken in ecofin .
i do not see any disadvantage in the existence of various levels of coordination , particularly when these are institutionalised in the treaty itself .
question no 9 by ( h-0458 / 00 ) :
subject : trying to discover , through clouds of secrecy , what the council has decided in previous answers to me , the portuguese presidency has insisted that everything decided by the council is open to the public .
i have expressed continuing deep scepticism about the council 's claims .
i discovered this from a newspaper , but where could i have found it legitimately through the council 's officially allegedly open documentation ?
the member ' s question begins by noting that the portuguese presidency has insisted that everything decided by the council is open to the public . yet this assertion by the council causes the honourable member some confusion .
on the specific case mentioned , what is happening is as follows .
in accordance with the basic regulation of the common fisheries policy , the member states , having notified the commission , may exchange all or part of their fishing quotas .
the same article establishes that member states shall annually inform the commission of the criteria which they adopt internally for distributing their fishing quotas .
in this case the latter only needs to inform the commission to ensure the effective control and management of fish stocks .
we do not feel that there has been any breakdown in the transparency for which the council is responsible .
up in the gallery , listening to you and me , are visitors .
everything is open here in parliament .
they can hear what we are discussing and agree or disagree .
but the council of ministers meets in secret .
maybe you can slide out of this example and say it is a member state talking to the commission and they send them a letter .
nevertheless these matters are done in secret .
if we - you and i - want the public to understand and agree with the decisions we take , surely you agree with me that it must be done in public ?
i do not agree , mr newton dunn . no government in the world takes its management decisions in public .
we can discuss the issue of whether or not legislative decisions should be taken in public .
this is something which we have been discussing in the intergovernmental conference .
however , we have not yet reached a definitive conclusion and until then the council rules are what they are .
i do not feel that this is a negative practice on the part of the council as we are actually working in line with the provisions of the treaty .
question no 10 by ( h-0460 / 00 ) :
is it also aware that this project has been condemned by the german and united states governments but supported by the british government ?
will the council press the world bank to abandon the scheme and the british government to withdraw its support ?
mr president , i will be very brief . the council has not examined the issue raised in the member ' s question .
the member states are responsible for assessing the specific projects to be financed by the world bank .
with regard to projects for tibet financed by the european union through its cooperation programme , the eu ' s position is that these projects must benefit native tibetans .
can i say firstly that i was astonished by the minister 's response to my honourable friend on the subject of human rights in egypt .
if europe does not stand for human rights then i do not know what it does stand for .
i would like to test him , if i may , on tibet because tibet has now been illegally occupied by china for many years .
the world bank has now recognised this and i understand is abandoning its so-called western poverty project proposal .
mr bowis , i note your concerns and we will certainly convey these to the member states .
however , i must say that the european union has not ignored the issue of tibet .
for example , troikas of heads of mission have been sent on fact-finding missions to tibet .
this issue is also regularly raised in the dialogue on human rights between the european union and china .
the last round which took place in lisbon on 25 february was preceded by a démarche with the chinese authorities which included the problem of human rights in tibet .
the european union is not hiding from the issue of human rights in tibet . however , as the member must be aware , the european union has not in recent years taken a clear position on the basic issue .
no definitive decision has been made within the european union on tackling the basic issue and this is a point which must be raised openly .
the european union has a lot more than just the ability to send investigative parties , have discussions , make recommendations and so forth .
in the case of egypt , as has already been said , we have the european-mediterranean programmes and association agreements .
in the case of china we have very many major trading arrangements and , potentially , their accession to the wto .
could we not use our power , our muscle , in order to achieve our human rights objectives and not just go on talking and talking without seeing any results ?
i can only repeat what i said about the fact that , within the european union , no official joint position has been adopted on the tibet issue , regardless of the human rights issue .
on this issue of human rights in particular , the reactions and attitudes of the eu must be proportional to the importance of the issue .
although this is certainly an important issue in terms of discussing china ' s accession to the world trade organisation , for example , it cannot be used to block negotiations of this significance .
we must find a measure which is appropriate for the reactions and the various situations .
question no 11 by ( h-0462 / 00 ) :
although these measures are carried out by member states , the council controls their actual application through its competent bodies .
moreover , a 1999 decision of the schengen executive committee approved a mutual aid project for the exchange of officials to give assistance and advice in carrying out security and control tasks at external borders .
such measures are coordinated within the competent bodies of the council but do not for the time being cover any african countries .
in terms of addressing the deep-rooted reasons for people wanting to escape and emigrate from certain african countries , we can refer to the action plan for morocco approved in the council in october 1999 .
this action plan is one of a set of five , each containing an exhaustive and coherent approach focused on the existing situation in a country of origin or transit of asylum-seekers which is regarded as being important .
for each country selected , the action plan presents a balanced combination of options which the european union offers in terms of foreign affairs , development and humanitarian and economic assistance .
in the action plan for morocco , which specifically covers the situation referred to by the honourable member , this country is regarded as a country of origin and transit for economic migration to the european countries .
also recommended is the promotion of direct foreign investment and vocational training , in which small companies are also involved , and assistance for the voluntary return and reintegration of moroccans who live in eu countries .
to achieve this objective , poverty must be combated and living conditions and employment opportunities must be improved , conflicts must be prevented and democratic states consolidated .
this requires greater coherence in the internal and external policies of the union which are the responsibility of both the eu and the member states .
partnership with third countries also constitutes a key element in the success of this policy .
the eu is aware that , in order to implement the action plan for morocco , partnership and cooperation with the moroccan authorities will be needed .
in this context , in june of last year , a mission to morocco took place before the action plan was finalised in order to establish a dialogue with the moroccan authorities .
another mission of this type is now planned for the end of this month , specifically intended for holding discussions with the moroccan intermediaries .
as i have said , the eu ' s policy covers development and humanitarian and economic assistance for morocco .
the consolidation of the action plan for morocco is clearly a long-term strategy but it is through the dialogue now under way in this context and on the association council that progress will be made .
i would like to believe from this long answer , which i did not fully understand , that the council has a well-intentioned attitude to this very serious problem .
i believe that you have been very explicit , that you have answered in many words , but these words disguise a low level of effectiveness .
the european union , together with morocco , and employing control measures for ships in the straits , would thereby prevent these losses of human lives which now number more than a thousand , and which are our responsibility .
the monitoring centre for immigration is nothing more than a story in the press .
mr president-in-office of the council , are you not in favour of a periodic assessment ?
mrs izquierdo rojo , firstly i must say that i agree with you .
this is indeed a very serious situation involving regular and even daily human tragedy which must be addressed .
the spanish authorities have been in contact on this issue with the moroccan authorities and the spanish prime minister , mr aznar , had a meeting just recently with his moroccan counterpart about this problem .
development measures are being introduced in the northern area of morocco , which are starting to improve this situation and the economic conditions that have led to these migratory flows .
as for the possibility of us periodically carrying out a quantitative assessment of these incidents , i believe that the spanish authorities may be able to provide the necessary information in this respect .
this information is in fact widely available within spain as it is distributed by the spanish authorities .
they are measures which are intended to work at the root of this situation by creating the conditions to keep the moroccan people in their own country .
they are development measures which are within the spirit of the euro-mediterranean partnership .
i realise that your immediate reaction may be that the practical effect of this type of long-term measure is limited .
i did say that these measures would involve many small steps .
we must all realise that the european union has a set of policies which it aims to implement and that these policies involve strategic choices .
these choices cannot be systematically prejudiced by overly general actions leading to worse humanitarian effects than may have occurred anyway .
we must realise that , in their bilateral relations with morocco , the spanish authorities are currently responsible for solving part of the problem .
we cannot turn the european union into a kind of technical instrument for the practical resolution of specific situations .
question no 12 by ( h-0466 / 00 ) :
subject : decision concerning deployment of eu military personnel the decision to strengthen eu emergency forces for crisis management has raised the question of the legal basis for the deployment of eu military personnel .
according to the swedish government 's interpretation of the decision taken at cologne in 1999 , a relevant un security council resolution has to have been adopted .
will the council therefore state where and when a formal council decision was taken to the effect that military personnel from the european union may be deployed only after a un security council resolution has been adopted ?
mr president , the decision by the member states to develop their military capability by 2003 was taken in helsinki . the headline goal specifies a capacity of 50 000 to 60 000 personnel .
this decision reaffirmed that the european union ' s crisis management actions will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the united nations charter and the objectives of the osce ' s charter for european security .
yet a un security council resolution is not needed to generally legitimise the eu ' s action .
however , you should note that some of the petersberg tasks may be carried out without the authorisation or approval of the un security council .
in fact the petersberg tasks include , and i quote , ' humanitarian and rescue tasks , peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management , including peace making ' .
therefore , only in the latter , for which the use of military force is required , is the existence of a un security council resolution considered necessary .
thank you for your answer , but i am afraid that it still does not provide proper clarification .
the swedish foreign minister has stated that the expression ' in accordance with the principles of the un charter ' is to be interpreted as ' following a decision in the un ' s security council ' .
she also said , in the course of last year ' s conference in cologne , that , if other countries wanted to align themselves with the un , sweden would have the option of using its veto .
moreover , i should like to hear a still clearer statement . can or cannot eu military personnel be deployed without a clear decision in the un ' s security council or in the osce ?
it ought to be easy to answer yes or no to that question .
mr gahrton , the petersberg tasks have several dimensions .
some are purely humanitarian , for example rescue tasks . do you really think that we need to have a un security council resolution in order to carry out a rescue task in a serious humanitarian situation ?
i also clearly said that any situation which may involve the use of military force , namely peace-making , naturally requires recourse and subordination to the security council .
therefore , the spirit of the un charter will naturally be followed in the type of activity which the european union may carry out within those petersberg tasks which do not involve the use of military force .
i am still not quite clear about your answer and would just like to ask whether you think that governments in neutral countries are being somewhat economical with the truth ?
mr gahrton said that his government stated that it is only after a un security council resolution has been adopted .
but from what you have said , that is not the case .
it appears that governments in neutral countries have a tendency to mislead citizens .
is that the case ?
mrs mckenna , the agreement reached in helsinki allowing these new military structures to be established was a carefully considered agreement which was prepared under the finnish presidency .
as you know , finland is a country which has very legitimate national concerns in this respect and which clearly will have taken these aspects into account .
we expressly accept the need for this security council resolution where military forces are to be used in a given context .
they are not deceiving their people nor are they being economical with the truth .
they are saying exactly what their commitment is .
clearly , their right of final veto over any decision is always guaranteed by the decision-making mechanism itself .
therefore , they can decide on a case-by-case basis as they see fit .
this is the fundamental rule of the european union for any situation requiring the participation of military forces .
mr president , there were approximately one hundred military conflicts in the nineties , the majority of which were civil wars .
i want to ask whether , in connection with the scenarios that have been gone through , a consensus has emerged that it will not be possible to deal authoritatively with certain types of conflict under the existing treaty .
in other words , is it agreed that certain military conflicts come within nato ' s or some other organisation ' s sphere of authority but definitely not under the eu ' s ?
i will only say that this military capability , this intervention capacity of the european union and this extension of its area of activity are all specified in the treaty of amsterdam which entered into force in may last year .
it is only since then that these issues have been raised .
question no 13 by ( h-0471 / 00 ) :
subject : arms supplies to mexico the forthcoming export of p-90 revolvers to mexico is further proof that belgium is not very particular about human rights .
following the insurrection in chiapas there is evidence of increasingly serious violations of human rights in mexico , with torture , arbitrary arrests and ' disappearances ' etc .
does the council feel that these supplies of arms to mexico are in conformity with the european code of conduct ?
if so , is there not a case for tightening up the code of conduct ?
if not , what will be the council 's response to the member state involved , belgium ?
as you know , the european union ' s position on arms exports is set out in the code of conduct approved in june 1998 .
respect for human rights is one of the code ' s main conditions which must be met in order for authorisation to be granted .
although decisions are taken individually by each member state , the latter must take full account of the provisions of the code of conduct . this is therefore a matter of political good faith .
the council does not receive any information on the reasons why member states grant or refuse export licences and therefore cannot assess the grounds on which these decisions are based .
however , particularly since the establishment of the code of conduct , the exchange of information on arms exports has begun to occur within the european union .
this exchange is the subject of an annual report and will clearly help to identify common ways of tackling the problems .
we must realise , however , that this issue is still subject to subsidiarity in that the decisions are taken by each member state , even though the code of conduct forms the backdrop and reference for these decisions .
mr president-in-office of the council , allow me to hide my amazement at your reply .
it is , of course , the case that with this conduct of conduct , we only have a very weak tool at our disposal to combat inadmissible arms exports .
i would like to ask you if there has ever been consultation within the council to tighten up this code of conduct or to make it more easily enforceable ?
i fear that the same fate that has befallen our foreign and security policy as a whole , and which has been discussed so many times , will also befall this code of conduct .
at the end of the day , we rely on goodwill and , if that is not there , we might as well forget it .
mrs maes , i almost totally agree with what you have just said .
however , the current code of conduct was the only one possible .
the code of conduct was regarded at the time as a very important qualitative step forward in terms of the disparate practices of the member states which existed at that time .
the aim was to tie the various member states to a basic set of principles and to the observance of certain standards , while still leaving them completely free in this matter .
this is what is happening today .
i realise that the code of conduct is very weak , it particularly does not have a binding nature and cannot go any further than a political sanction .
this is the big test that the european union and its member states will have to face in the future .
question no 14 by ( h-0474 / 00 ) :
i would have been surprised if there had not been a question on this issue which is why i am glad that it has finally come up .
the council of ministers of the european union does not have to express an opinion on a decision taken by 14 member states in the context of their bilateral relations with austria .
this is not a matter for the council .
as this is not the case , what is happening now in the relations between the 14 member states and austria is a bilateral issue which is not the responsibility of the council .
thank you for agreeing to take the question .
i am certainly taken aback by the president-in-office 's response .
the fact is that the sanctions were imposed by the council .
i cannot see how the council can now wash its hands of at least discussing the possibility of lifting those sanctions .
i should like to ask the president-in-office if he is aware that recent public opinion polls in austria indicate that over 80 % of austrian citizens want to see the sanctions lifted .
how then can the council continue to ignore the democratic decision of the austrian people ?
does the president-in-office not agree that failure to lift the sanctions now is undermining the democratic foundations on which this union was established ?
i would ask him to give this house this evening an assurance that he will use his undoubted influence to have the matter discussed at the summit in your country next week .
certainly , what is happening does not reflect the european aspiration to unity .
i am extremely disappointed that the council , in this way , would want to wash its hands of what is a very serious matter .
mr hyland , the council is composed of fifteen countries .
i am not aware that austria has participated in any debate or vote in council in which any type of measure has been adopted against it .
no eu body has adopted any measure against austria .
the bilateral decisions , not sanctions , which were taken by the 14 member states in respect of austria are political acts which one country is entitled to adopt in respect of another .
every country has every right , with regard to the development of the political situation in another country , to adopt an attitude and to draw the due consequences from this .
these are the famous ' sanctions ' .
if any country has interpreted this attitude more extensively then this is a matter for each country .
these ' sanctions ' are therefore bilateral as each country is doing what it wishes in this respect and the responsibility is collective .
the responsibility for the position taken by the 14 member states was freely assumed by these countries .
any of these countries is free to disengage itself from these measures and we have to ask ourselves why up to now none of the 14 countries has done this .
this issue is therefore not a matter for the council .
the austrian authorities have had the opportunity to raise this issue within the european union .
however , this decision is not a community decision but a bilateral one , whether you like it or not .
i wanted to ask the president-in-office to clarify something .
you are saying that the council is not getting involved in these bilateral measures because , strictly speaking , it is not a council decision .
so has there not been any consultation within the council at any time ?
it is nonetheless being mooted that the sanctions will be brought up again in feira .
you are saying that austria might raise the issue again , but that is not possible in a council meeting .
it will thus need to be raised again in separate meetings of a bilateral nature .
do you yourself not think that this is a little peculiar ?
what i must say to mrs maes is that we are all austrians in that we all have citizenship rights which must be respected in austria .
as this is not an eu matter , this issue was never placed on the agenda and this will not occur under the portuguese presidency in any formal council body .
the representatives of the austrian government are clearly totally free to raise this issue and will have every opportunity to debate this if the member states want to do so .
at the lisbon european council , the 14 member states decided to entrust the portuguese prime minister with giving a collective response .
at the informal meeting in the azores there was a debate and several member states expressed their opinions on the situation .
i am not sure what will happen in feira but clearly doctor wolfgang schüssel is totally free to express his opinions and to see the reaction of the other member states to his words and arguments .
i would like to ask the president-in-office , finally , if he and his council recognise the outcome of democratic elections within this union ?
secondly , does he believe that the portuguese presidency acted in haste as a result of a series of telephone calls throughout europe when that decision was taken ?
would it not have been wiser to summon a meeting of the heads of state for an important decision like this which - remember - will have consequences long after our time here in the european parliament ?
i would like to hear the views of the portuguese presidency , and maybe other presidencies , when others coming from the extreme right or indeed the extreme left enter government within the union .
this should be a europe of unity and solidarity .
to use a slang word it is a ' cop-out ' to say that it is not a matter for the council .
someone must take an initiative to resolve this serious problem . it has given stature to an individual who does not deserve that stature .
in fact it has strengthened his position , not weakened it .
with regard to the result of the austrian elections , i clearly said that we fully respect the result of these elections .
austria is a free country and one where the elections are held in a totally legal manner and with full transparency .
the problem is that the result of this free election , as has happened in the past in other countries , brought a certain party to power .
you should realise that there is actually something strange in the austrian internal situation .
the party which received the most votes was the social democratic party which did not want to form a government .
the party with the second highest number of votes was the fpo which was not invited to form a government .
it is rather strange , in terms of usual constitutional arrangements , that in a european country the second-placed party was not invited to form a government but the third-placed party was instead .
therefore , this is not a case of business as usual . it actually involves a kind of reassessment given the potential capacity of mr haider to become the leader of an austrian government .
we do not dispute the austrian elections and we do not dispute the right of the austrian people to choose the government they want .
we do not feel that this issue is a matter for the european union but is rather for the other 14 governments to decide .
why ?
what has changed in the austrian situation which could lead us to change our attitude ?
only time ?
we consider that it is the austrians and the austrian government which must change if they want us to adopt a different attitude .
that is the essence of the matter .
why systematically place the onus on the 14 countries ?
why must the 14 member states change ?
what has happened in austria to justify this change ?
clearly this does not necessarily mean that we will not consider other ways in the future of assessing the development of this situation and in fact this is what will happen in the coming days .
thank you very much , mr seixas da costa .
may this success match that of the portuguese football team at the beginning of euro 2000 .
may you achieve much for europe !
since the time allotted to questions to the council has elapsed , questions nos 15 to 28 will be replied to in writing .
that concludes questions to the council .
( the sitting was suspended at 7.35 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. ) .
change to the agenda
on the recommendation of the presidency and in accordance with rule 111 of our rules of procedure i propose an amendment of the agenda for this current part-session .
the committee on economic affairs has decided to apply the simplified procedure in accordance with rule 158 of the rules of procedure to both texts .
i therefore propose that they be included in accordance with the procedure without debate .
is there any objection to the proposal ?
( parliament gave its assent )
reconstruction of central america
.
it destroyed crops , homes and infrastructures of every type , thereby jeopardising the future of its peoples .
europe ' s response was immediate and significant , through the stockholm conference , and it was consolidated , following the european parliament ' s proposal , in the commission ' s initiative which we are currently debating .
i would like to highlight four issues .
the first relates to our assumption of responsibility in the event of these catastrophes .
furthermore , our model of unequal development leads to poverty and indebtedness in these countries .
it is a contradiction to preach the reconstruction of central america taking account of respect for the environment , according to a model of sustainable development , while we continue to maintain the same economic relations with those countries .
the second issue involves the global objective of our assistance .
the commission ' s proposal is sensible insofar as it centres its attention on two fields : health and education .
however , it should be more ambitious , so that it may coordinate and integrate all the different initiatives in those countries .
this requires a substantial increase in our staff , a measure which this house supports .
in this respect , two facts worry us .
aid for reconstruction must be accompanied by firm and accountable commitments to safeguarding human rights on the part of the guatemalan government .
the third question concerns the way in which we are going to carry out aid and regional coordination and integration .
that is why we need to carry out internal and external audits of the application of our aid .
increasing our effectiveness as the european union also means that we must participate officially in the stockholm monitoring group .
the fourth and last point is currently the most important : the amount of aid .
although it is considerable , we believe that the amount indicated by the commission , eur 250 million , is insufficient given the magnitude of the disaster and the slow rate of the area ' s recovery .
the european parliament therefore requests a significant increase .
we are concerned by the items appearing today in the press indicating that the commission intends to reduce all european union aid , including that destined for latin america , because of its commitments in kosovo .
we believe that we cannot behave in such an absurd way , since for latin america this aid offers hope of escaping underdevelopment and freeing itself from the heavy yoke which originates from the north .
the european parliament has already stated that it would not commit itself to any action which would mean cuts in the aid to other parts of the world .
we therefore insist that this is a crucial and key point .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , some regions in the world are struck by the hand of fate several times in quick succession .
in the 1980s , the european union made a major commitment to central america in the san josé process , in order to help establish peace and democracy in this region .
this process was a success .
and then , just a few years ago , these countries were again hard hit , this time by a terrible hurricane , and they are still suffering the consequences .
thank goodness that europe is again taking action , offering assistance and helping to reconstruct central america .
we need to publicise the fact that the european union is funding at least 62 % of public development aid in central america .
this entitles the european union to play a political role in central america , which is not just the preserve of its large neighbours ; europe too can make a contribution here to peace , democracy and reconstruction .
we therefore welcome the commission ' s proposal .
the committee on budgets supports the idea of earmarking eur 250 million for this region for the period from 1999 to 2004 .
it is also a good idea to make this aid conditional upon a commitment by the countries to work together .
that was the model used in europe after the second world war , when the duty to work together , cooperate and overcome borders were the sine qua non for marshall plan funds .
our contribution to reconstruction aid will likewise be conditional upon a commitment to peaceful coexistence and cooperation .
i also expressly agree with the rapporteur : we should not allow the reconstruction of kosovo to be funded , as it were , from the budget for central america .
the commission report predates the kosovo conflict and we have made no changes to it .
we stand by the sum proposed for central america .
i think that is the most important signal we can send out today .
mr president , our committee undoubtedly agrees with mr marset campos ' s report .
however , i should like to draw the house ' s attention to a number of points which , as far as we are concerned , are right at the top of the international aid priority list .
international aid must , without fail , be well coordinated .
the commission , for its part , must set up suitable structures on the ground .
however , it must also cooperate as efficiently as possible with the international organisations which have been working there for several years already .
the same applies when it comes to involving the people affected , especially the indigenous population .
we must work with these people on the ground during both planning and implementation , that is essential as far as we are concerned .
not only does it save costs , it increases efficiency and , more importantly , prevents fraud .
we know that in el salvador , for example , the erstwhile calderón government diverted aid of eur 1 million in order to win votes in the right-wing camp .
if we really want to help the countries devastated by the hurricane , then of course we need to do more than just implement a few aid projects on the ground .
we all know that full well .
it is therefore essential that we remit foreign debts and build up regional and , above all , sustainable structures in both the ecological and the economic sense of the word .
i take the same view as the previous speakers , that it is unacceptable for the council to argue that money now needs to be diverted from latin america to kosovo .
robbing peter to pay paul can hardly be called a policy ; on the contrary .
the council keeps heaping more and more tasks on to the commission and the european parliament ; it also needs to ensure that they can be funded by entering the relevant amounts in the budget .
mr president , as the rapporteur , mr marset , has said - and we support his words and his report - hurricane mitch has been the worst natural disaster in the history of central america .
a significant part of the economic and social infrastructure has been destroyed and there has been a great reduction in the region ' s capacity for production and export in the short and medium term .
the countries most affected , honduras and nicaragua , are the poorest in the region .
as the commission has said , the consequences of mitch will considerably reduce the results of the efforts towards economic recovery and investment made there during the last decade by the european union .
in april 1999 , the commission approved a special action plan , provided with eur 250 million , which this parliament fully supports in the terms in which it was approved .
with regard to the model for implementing this programme , the committee on development and cooperation supports option 1 proposed by the commission .
lastly , i believe it is also necessary to ask , within the strategic reconstruction plan , for the proposal of measures aimed at increasing credits from the european investment bank in that region .
mr president , i would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr marset campos , on the excellent report which he has presented to us .
this report has inevitably been influenced by the tragic consequences of hurricane mitch .
the european parliament - and i believe we should remember this - reacted immediately by calling an extraordinary meeting on 4 november 1998 which was attended by the commissioners then responsible .
in its resolution of 19 november , the european parliament expressed the terms in which the european union would respond to the situation created by hurricane mitch .
this response had to be formulated with the greatest diligence and speed through the approval of a strategic plan for the region within the shortest possible time limit .
i remember the date : november 18-19 1998 .
we must say that this request by the european parliament , at least with regard to diligence and speed , has not been attended to , and this is a cause for regret .
to transfer this responsibility to the budgetary authority is not correct . the commission must at all times ensure the appropriate allocation of resources in accordance with the priorities agreed .
in any event , commissioner , the countries of central america have not carried out a policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing .
they have included , unlike other geographical areas in their agreements with the european union , a democratic clause which provides an essential element on which the whole relationship is based .
the countries of central america have taken on very painful processes of structural adjustment which have meant great sacrifices for their societies .
they have done their duties with regard to the multilateral institutions and have fully complied with what the european union expected of them .
mr president , european civil society has already shown how sensitive it is to the tragedy suffered by the peoples of central america .
it is now time for our institutions , in the face of a disaster of this type , to be a match for our civil society and for the circumstances .
and since misfortune is never fair , particularly when meting out its after-effects , it is the poorer bands of society which , as always , have been worst affected .
this resolution has the advantage of going beyond emergencies .
the resolution explains in great detail that all this is possible provided that two conditions are upheld and satisfied .
first of all , we must activate the monitoring and inspection measures , in order to avoid wastage , unlawful activity and fraud .
to this end , the resolution calls for the european union to have sole responsibility for planning , execution and monitoring of the aid .
we are calling upon the commission to take up its responsibility , and we consider it vital that it does so if we are to provide effective aid .
however , the second condition is much more important : we need to increase the commission ' s financial and human resources .
the funds appropriated are not sufficient and the staffing is certainly inadequate .
in other words , mr president , members of the commission and the council , i feel that it is time for the european union to stop just declaring its solidarity and secure genuine , substantial fairness .
this plan must do more than just provide immediate alleviation of the effects of the hurricane : it must also bring about redistribution of the country ' s resources and restore the country ' s opportunities .
i would like to conclude by reiterating the invitation to the commission and the council contained in the resolution to support the total and immediate cancellation of the foreign debt .
mr president , there is little to add at this point in the debate , especially after the excellent report by mr marset , which i agree with completely .
however , i would like to stress certain things that he has said .
i will end , mr president , with the following quote : " we must be rebels , but we must also be competent " .
to interpret this in another context : let us show solidarity , but , in doing so , be efficient .
first : we must help with reconstruction in these countries .
the commission document provides a good basis for this , although some of what is written in it has yet to be implemented in practice .
i think it is particularly important to use the know-how of european organisations and organisations in member states for reconstruction and to involve non-governmental organisations and local experts .
i do not think that calling for more new posts in the european commission every time a new challenge arises is always the right response .
perhaps commission staff could be reassigned .
secondly : we must give these ill-fated countries greater access to european markets than we have done in the past .
i cannot see why nicaragua and honduras still fail to qualify for the same treatment .
i do not want to quote the perennial example of bananas - the report does that .
i support this passage and also what mr kreissl-dörfler has said .
i would like to quote the example of sugar .
in the case of sugar , which is an important product for nicaragua , nicaragua has no access of any importance to european markets .
it might help if we were to facilitate its access to the european markets .
the third challenge is that we need to fight the causes of these disasters .
i am well aware that we cannot simply say that the increase in greenhouse gases caused hurricane mitch .
however , there are many scientists who assume that it probably did .
we just cannot say for certain .
but all the scientific committees agree that the number of disasters such as this will increase significantly if we industrialised counties continue to pump out the greenhouse gases at the same rate .
they will of course affect all of us , but they will always affect poor people most , which is why we must at last take more decisive action here .
mr president , i should like to follow on from mr liese ' s closing comment on climate change , to which mr marset campos also referred .
it seems reasonable to suppose that it is not increasing by chance and that it really is the result of man-made climatic changes .
i would therefore like to see a link established between how we view these disasters and energy policy .
there really is a link and i should like to draw your attention to it .
i only wish there were not .
the second point i would like to make is that aid should be used to integrate central america .
this has been a perennial cause for concern to the european parliament and we have called for it on many occasions .
in the final analysis , of course , this is up to the people of central america .
but perhaps the shock triggered by hurricane mitch gives us an excuse to overcome the hostilities and difficulties between the individual countries .
in any case , the people would be grateful and , for the rest , our aid would be worthless without any progress with integration .
the third point i should like to make concerns the implementation of this aid .
i know that this is a comment which a parliamentarian should not make nowadays , but i make it nonetheless because i am right .
finally , i should like to point out that the hurricane in october 1998 went beyond central america .
it is now june 2000 .
in other words , we too are an unwieldy apparatus and perhaps we too need to consider how we can speed up the process .
even if we pass a resolution today , we are still a long way from building up the country ; on the contrary , it will take many years , perhaps a generation .
i consider that to be far too long .
i am also grateful for the support and confidence that parliament has given the commission on the implementation of this important community action plan .
the programme is based on the principle of sustainable development , as has been underlined by several speakers .
it provides for assistance in education , vocational training , public health and social housing .
the primary beneficiaries will be those who live in extremely disadvantaged rural areas where the consequences of the disaster are most acute .
attention will be paid in particular to the indigenous peoples and to reducing vulnerability to this kind of catastrophe in the future .
the commission is aware that the success of such an ambitious and complex programme also depends on the degree of coordination among the various actors present .
a coordination group is being set up between the commission and the member states .
another important element will be the stockholm follow-up group .
until now the commission has always been involved in an informal way in the activities carried out by this group .
in order to ensure maximum transparency , the commission will submit an annual report on the progress of the rprca to the member states and parliament .
a first report of the activities carried out by the commission has been distributed among the parliamentary committee on industry , external trade , research and energy .
following the initial emergency and other post-mitch aid , we are now actively preparing the implementation of this reconstruction programme .
the mobilisation of the statutory personnel necessary for decentralised management and implementation of the programme certainly delayed the rapid launch of the programme , as has been emphasised by several speakers .
these problems have now been overcome .
the first official will arrive in managua on 17 july and the remaining officials in the following weeks .
no further delays are expected at this point .
the commission is taking all necessary steps so that the programme can be in place and operational within the following three months .
i quite understand the arguments mr salafranca raised about human resources .
as you know , it is not a question specific to this debate .
however , you should bear in mind that for the kosovo programme we set up a specific agency .
in the case of this programme we had to deal with the staff who were available , due to the constraints of human resources .
let me stress - and i share the view of mr salafranca and others - that the amount of time it has taken to get this aid to the region is wholly unacceptable .
we cited it as an example in our recent proposals for the overall reform of our external assistance programmes .
additional measures have been adopted by the commission in the framework of the community action plan .
in addition , the commission is taking part in the hipc debt initiative , contributing some eur 50m to both honduras and nicaragua .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m .
asylum procedures
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the treaty of amsterdam has at last paved the way for joint action in the area of asylum law and refugee and immigration policy .
in my view , this was long overdue , because the decision to move from a purely economic community to political union was taken a long time ago .
that the treaty of amsterdam moved in this direction was therefore all the more important .
i think that we have chosen a good approach to this issue over recent months during our discussions of the commission ' s working paper .
i know from my own group , i must add , that , because of how the report is drafted , the view of hardly anyone here in the house is wholly represented .
that is precisely what happens when you make compromises and try to find a consensus .
you are satisfied on many points , but not always 100 % .
allow me to highlight the main points which i think are important for future asylum procedures .
secondly : we must ensure that qualification procedures are shortened and simplified , without sacrificing sufficiently high standards of careful examination .
thirdly : our aim must be to allow asylum seekers to apply for asylum just once within the european union .
however , this means ensuring the same procedural law applies everywhere and is applied uniformly .
this means training officials in charge of processing applications to a high standard .
these officials must have access to cross-border information .
and we must also ensure that asylum seekers are treated in exactly the same way , wherever they make their application .
this includes welfare , accommodation etc .
we need to guarantee that , in theory , you will face the same procedure everywhere , irrespective of whether you make your application in spain , germany or england .
if we can guarantee that , then inversely , it is only logical to rule that just one application is allowed .
fourthly : i think that the member states of the eu should be required to draw up a uniform , binding list of countries subject to a visa requirement and safe third countries and countries of origin .
i know that some people are critical of this .
but , in my view , it is the only way to ensure that officials take decisions on the basis of the same criteria and to create legal certainty for applicants in the member states .
one important point which i should like to address , and which we have made clear several times in the report , is that the burden must be divided between the member states .
how exactly this burden will be divided obviously still needs to be discussed .
but one thing is clear : the door on which the majority of asylum seekers or refugees knocks cannot be left to chance .
one country alone should not have to bear the burden .
i know that asylum law is a difficult and politically sensitive issue but i think that we have made a start in the discussions in committee over recent months .
we have discussed extremely constructively and fairly with each other .
mr president , allow me to start by thanking mr schmitt , not just for his report , but also for the excellent cooperation and for what he has just said to us .
he speaks from the heart .
common principles were indeed seen as more important than individual political objectives .
the right to asylum is enshrined in various treaties but , because of different definitions and interpretations by national courts , the law is applied to differing degrees .
this obviously contradicts the principles and objectives of the ec treaty , title 4 of which refers to asylum policy as an important means of establishing an area of peace , security and justice .
establishing a uniform asylum law and harmonised implementing provisions is therefore a community objective .
the document presented by the commission starts by explaining that legally binding instruments need to be adopted for the asylum procedure .
i think that we shall have a highly constructive vote in favour of our common ideal tomorrow .
i wish us all the courage and strength to push forward on the final point which you addressed .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to highlight two positive things .
the first is the working document presented by the commission , which was the starting point for the report .
it is a sound basis for instituting a debate which should culminate at some point in a legal act setting out common standards for an asylum procedure .
the second is the report , which i particularly wish to highlight , because the rapporteur really has succeeded in finding a broad consensus right across the political divide on a very delicate matter .
that is no easy task and we have all experienced quite the opposite here , which is why this is an excellent piece of work .
i should like to pick up on three points which i think are particularly important and which i would ask the commission to take into consideration .
the first is the question of how to divide the burden and has already been addressed .
we must not concentrate on just one aspect ; we need to remain receptive to a distribution in terms of people .
if you look at refugee movements , you will see that they always affect the same countries .
austria , for example , where i come from , is always near the top of the list when it comes to admitting temporary refugees or asylum seekers .
it is on a par with luxembourg , belgium and the netherlands .
others have a much lighter burden to bear and greater solidarity between the member states is needed here .
i should like to highlight the question of shortening and simplifying the qualification procedures without - and that is the crux of the matter - compromising careful examination .
it is an important point , because asylum seekers are entitled to a fast decision and a fast answer on their future status .
the third point is that which gives legal certainty and which , when implemented , helps to ensure that identical decisions are taken in all member states .
it is the point which requires us to keep up-to-date lists of safe third countries and countries of origin .
it will help enormously if we manage to draw up these lists .
it attracted a broad consensus but i fear that this consensus will not perhaps hold up if all the amendments proposed by the greens are included .
they want much that is positive , but they want a lot that is total , as mrs merkel once remarked .
i call on them to consider withdrawing these proposed amendments so that the broad consensus can be maintained .
so let me say straight away that you , mr schmitt , have carried out what i see as an exemplary piece of work .
assert yourself in your party .
i guarantee that you will have the support of the german social democrats , if no-one else .
it is clear from what mr pirker has said that you have obviously been engaged in real missionary work in your group ; but good works deserve to be praised .
that is one of the reasons why we are telling our fellow members in the group of the greens / european free alliance that we reject all their proposed amendments except one .
this one amendment deals with remand pending deportation , which we too feel is an instrument worth examining .
i am not judging that .
we shall reject your proposed amendments because we need to learn in this parliament , as legislators , that we should and must deal in the legislative process with the subject matter which needs to inform the law .
but here we are talking about the procedural , not the substantive right to asylum .
that is something else entirely .
the greens ' proposed amendments contain a discussion of the content , not the form of asylum law .
that is a huge step forward for us .
mr president , fellow members .
a word on a personal note : today is the last sitting in which i shall act as coordinator of the group of the party of european socialists .
i shall soon be devoting myself to different tasks in my group .
this was the fun part of what i wanted to say .
what shape is the european asylum policy in ?
that is hard to say , as there is not really a european asylum policy to speak of .
we in this parliament , the delegates as well as their predecessors , have for years been pushing in the right direction .
the previous european commission may have had the will , but did not have any power .
the bottleneck , as we quite often noticed , was located within the council of ministers .
most governments showed willing too , but they were subject to the rule of unanimity .
then there was the tampere summit .
dozens of proposals were submitted there , also in this area of policy .
things were looking up , according to many journalists .
they had , however , overlooked the fact that the crippling policy of decision-making on the basis of unanimity still applied .
it is unlikely that a scoreboard will be able to unlock this paralysis within policy .
all it will do is make it clear to the outside world which body and country are responsible for the paralysis within policy .
what needs to happen now ?
all sorts of things need to happen .
we will be voting in favour of the tenor of the report and we are backing it .
mr president , the treaty of amsterdam made one thing clear : there is no way of getting past a common asylum and immigration policy .
the initiatives of the european union on reuniting families , the anti-discrimination package , temporary protection for war refugees and , at long last , the attempt to harmonise asylum law make this very clear .
mr pirker , i do not see a problem with this - you can reject them again tomorrow .
one way or another , we shall be voting in favour of mr schmitt ' s report .
these are the usual parliamentary rules of play and with them we can all live happily under one roof - that is my assumption .
tempus fugit !
we must implement the treaty of amsterdam by the end of 2004 .
there are difficulties at hand though .
the national states are often not prepared as yet to support european rules .
but this should not divert us from our purpose .
mr schmitt ' s report goes in the right direction and calls on the commission to take specific steps by proposing legislation .
