after decades of a bipolar world , the situation of unipolarity must be transitory and in this the european union ' s contribution will be decisive .
peace must continue to be the grand plan of european construction but this will not happen by itself .
the choices seem clear , the objective is challenging and its achievement will be decisive .
reforms must be implemented , major financial resources and means must be identified , made compatible and mobilised .
the commitment of the member states is essential .
the current challenges cannot be deferred or hesitated over .
i congratulate mrs lalumière on her work .
- ( pt ) mr president , i must very quickly highlight the usefulness of this debate and the importance of all the interventions in terms of better preparing the council on this issue .
mrs lalumière ' s report is excellent , particularly in its balance and the relevance of many of its observations .
the report to be presented by the portuguese presidency to the feira european council next week will dispel many of the doubts and clarify many of the aspects which we have addressed here .
this report is the result of our commitment to carry out in full the mandate established in helsinki .
we must determine the extent of these mechanisms and the appropriateness of these various dimensions in terms which express the different sensitivities indicated here .
as for the eu-nato link , all the concerns expressed about how the creation of a common european security and defence policy may reflect negatively on the relationship with nato are unfounded .
on the contrary , we believe that this mechanism will allow us to independently reinforce a particular dimension without creating any type of barrier in our relationship with nato .
we hope that the feira european council will enshrine these as the definitive model in this area .
on the issue of parliamentary representation , we obviously appreciate the sensitivity of this house with regard to its greater involvement in these matters .
this point has been and is being discussed in the intergovernmental conference and we will see to what extent these claims are accepted .
in any case , it is essential , particularly with regard to the national parliaments , to guarantee their association with any future development in this area .
we too share these concerns .
civilian crisis management has been one of the aspects highlighted by the portuguese presidency , particularly bearing in mind the concerns felt within the council and also expressed in this house about this dimension .
the day after tomorrow the first meeting of the committee for civilian crisis management will take place .
this committee was specifically created during the portuguese presidency .
finally , on the last issue of the armaments group , this group is continuing its work and will remain active within the weu .
mr president , it has been an interesting debate .
we have heard plenty of good sense in the course of it , as one would anticipate .
i shall be mercifully brief .
i do not want to come between parliament and its preprandial democratic duty .
however , there are a couple of points i should like to make .
we need our own crisis units in the commission , but we should keep that small .
i want to make it absolutely clear that i have no intention of duplicating within the commission the sort of structures which are necessarily going to be created in the council .
secondly , mrs lalumière spoke very pointedly about the importance of taking decisions much more quickly .
i am bound to say that is one of my obsessions .
it is one of my obsessions in relation to , for instance , meda regulation and in relation to the balkans .
we brought forward a new regulation for speeding up our delivery of assistance to the balkans .
we have made proposals about asymmetric trade measures for the balkans , which are now being considered by the council and , in due course , will be considered by parliament .
we have made proposals for cleaning up the danube .
those are all areas where we have brought forward proposals .
i hope we can get quick decisions .
so in my judgement the importance of taking decisions more quickly is one which is relevant at every stage of our activities .
the sooner we face up to that the better , not least for the credibility of a common foreign and security policy .
once again i thank the honourable member for her superb report .
i can only imagine the amount of work that went into it .
all of us know the amount of wisdom that went into it as well .
president .
i have received two motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 42 ( 5 ) of the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on thursday at 12 noon .
welcome
colleagues , it is a great pleasure to welcome a delegation from the australian house of representatives and the senate , who have just taken their seats in the official gallery .
i extend a warm welcome to the australian delegation , which is here to attend the 24th european parliament / australia interparliamentary meeting , taking place here in strasbourg on 14 and 15 june .
the honourable bruce baird heads the australian delegation , which is composed of three members of the house of representatives and two members of the senate .
the european parliament and the australian parliament initiated their direct political dialogue in 1981 and over the years this dialogue has encompassed a broad range of issues .
we now look forward to the strengthening of our cooperation with australia .
i wish you all a successful and an enjoyable stay here in strasbourg .
vote
mr perry has the floor on a point of order .
madam president , outside the door of this chamber there is somebody dressed as a cigarette packet .
i have no objections to people dressing as cigarette packets but i have objections to what i take to be political manifestations outside the very door to the hemicycle .
is this allowed under our rules ?
madam president , i understand that we will be voting on the amendments to the lalumière resolution tomorrow and not today .
i should like to point out that there is an important typographical error in amendment no 39 , which members will have .
it mentions the " president of canada " .
this should read : the " parliament of canada " .
there is no president of canada .
the head of state of canada is her majesty the queen , who is also the head of state of australia .
calendar of part-sessions of parliament for the year 2001
dell ' alba ( tdi ) .
these amendments have been deemed to be inadmissible .
we could therefore quite easily have voted in favour of our amendments , waited for the results of the igc and adapted the calendar accordingly .
i dispute the statement that these amendments , supported by many of my fellow members , are inadmissible .
there is therefore some confusion as to what we are voting on .
that is why we did not feel that we could deem these amendments to be acceptable .
on the other hand , all the other amendments have been deemed to be acceptable , and indeed has always been the case .
( parliament adopted the calendar of part-sessions as amended )
simplified procedure - without report
( parliament approved the initiative )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( the president approved the common position )
madam president , on behalf of my group , i would like to request that the vote on maaten report be postponed until july .
mr fiori , to make things quite clear , you are therefore asking for the vote to be postponed , pursuant to rule 146 ( 1 ) of the rules of procedure .
is there a speaker in favour of this request and one against ?
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , this is surely an extremely important report on what is without doubt a serious issue .
i think that we shall not do justice to the significance and importance of this issue if we complete this procedure in such a short space of time .
there are so many proposals - 120 in all - that i fear that majorities will be reached and results will emerge which are not compatible with each other .
we really do need more careful voting and coordination both in and between the groups so that we achieve a result which is worthy of its name .
madam president , i must state my opposition to this request to postpone the vote . i do not think that there is any shortage of arguments against taking such action .
i would remind you that the council postponed its review of this dossier until it had heard parliament ' s views .
if we postpone our vote , the tobacco industry will gain even more time , since the council will then not be able to state its position until the end of june .
furthermore , i think that mr maaten and the commission on the environment , public health and consumer policy have produced a good piece of work .
it is true that many amendments have been tabled and also that in future we will have to make efforts to improve our work so that fewer amendments are tabled in plenary .
as it happens , however , i do not think that this would in any way justify postponing the vote .
everything is in place for a vote to be held .
( parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
president .
i congratulate mr maaten and i shall take this opportunity , ladies and gentlemen , to tell you that i have received several letters from members who would like us to respect the non-smoking areas because they suffer from asthma .
( applause )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
report ( a5-0144 / 2000 ) by mrs lulling , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs ,
( parliament adopted both legislative resolutions in successive votes )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
please have the legal implications checked as a matter of urgency .
we have clearly passed a resolution which violates the spirit and probably even the letter of the treaty .
because this could result in our holding one-day sessions here and five-day sessions elsewhere .
that cannot be the purpose of the compromise .
apart from that , it is a huge waste of money to cut a day here and then hold additional plenary part-sessions .
explanations of vote - parliament ' s calendar of part-sessions - 2001
by the same token , and out of respect for the rule of law , i voted against the amendments which seek to cancel the additional part-sessions in brussels .
it is legitimate to attempt to change the terms of the treaties regarding our working venues , although it is not an intention that i share .
to whittle away , however , at the provisions of the treaty and the annexed acts is a method that is not worthy of the parliamentary institution .
mr president , i voted not to work on fridays in strasbourg although i am totally in favour of our meeting here .
i decided to vote not to work on fridays because friday was inconvenient for almost all the members .
this is because parliament ' s work is not being organised properly .
i voted for the calendar but i would like to make it clear - as mr speroni has just said - that we waste a great deal of time in fruitless activities .
voting on the amendments to the recitals of all the legislation , even those which merely lay down guidelines , when all is said done , makes it impossible for us to carry out our mandate .
directives and regulations should be produced and voted upon in parliament , but parliament must not waste time in other sorts of debates which could be dealt with by the committees .
mr president , i agree wholeheartedly with what mr posselt and mrs flesch have said about this unfortunate vote on cancelling friday sittings here in strasbourg .
i take the view that this violates the treaty and violates the agreement on where parliament sits .
i am really pleased that the ministers in the council of ministers and not parliament continue to decide where parliament sits and i hope that the intergovernmental conference will not change that .
it is hard to understand why we are passing a resolution on a four-day working week when the treaty refers to session weeks .
every employee in the community , hundreds of millions of people , work a five-day week .
once we have a four-day week for everyone else , because the self-employed already work whenever they want , then we can also say that a session week is only four days long .
i think it is a disgrace , it is a waste of money and as for the ridiculous ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
mr president , i too should like to endorse the statement made by my fellow member from the liberal group , mrs flesch .
i would like to add something further .
it is a fact that very few members of the house are present here in strasbourg on friday mornings .
nevertheless , i think it is scandalous that some members want to prevent others from working on friday mornings .
i urge the bureau to be consistent and to also remove the possibility of meps ' receiving money for fridays on which they have not worked !
.
the current practice of moving parliament between brussels and strasbourg implies high costs for the european taxpayer , and reduces the effectiveness of parliamentary work .
it undermines parliament 's credibility and political impact .
the solution to this problem would be to concentrate parliament 's work at only one place .
we call upon the member states to consider a change of the treaty , allowing the european parliament to decide upon its own seat .
in order to make this point we have voted for all amendments that aim to reduce the amount of time spent in strasbourg and increase that in brussels .
.
i have not missed one day in any of the parliamentary sessions since the election and , i believe , only two in the previous parliament .
it is therefore with some hesitation that i voted for the deletion of fridays from the strasbourg sessions .
i have come to the opinion that agendas for the friday sessions have been engineered to fill up the session and are becoming increasingly meaningless .
it does this institution no favours when , on a friday , there are fewer than a hundred members debating a resolution which is of no importance .
this parliament must restructure its mode of operation to reflect the changed working conditions .
mr president , i voted for the motion and i would just like to point something out : in italy , the schengen agreement is not always correctly applied .
according to the schengen agreement , there should not be any systematic checks and there should not be any obligation to present oneself to the customs authorities or notify them that one is leaving national territory .
i therefore call upon the commission to take action to ensure that the schengen agreement is respected and that the bureaucratic interference of the italian authorities ceases .
beysen recommendation ( a5-0153 / 2000 )
mr president , i voted for the beyson report , but this is a classic example of what i was referring to in the vote on abolishing friday sittings .
is it so that we know how many sweets have passed from italy into france or how many tractors have passed from germany into sweden , for example ?
this seems to me to be excessive bureaucracy as well as an unnecessary amount of work for parliament .
since we are recording the amount of goods which cross the borders , why do we not also record how many people cross from one country to another within the european union ?
but to what end ?
we must make life simpler for our citizens and simplify our legislation as well !
maaten report ( a5-0156 / 2000 )
mr president , i am totally in favour of this report safeguarding citizens ' health , the health of both active and passive smokers .
but when , in the past , have we ever succeeded in reducing tobacco consumption or cigarette smoking ?
only once , mr president .
' and when was that ? ' you may ask .
in 1848 , during the fight against the rule of the austro-hungarian empire in milan . in order to damage the empire ' s finances , the milanese managed to reduce consumption of cigarettes .
there we are : we should have written , ' smoking kills and governments are grateful for their saving in pension expenditure ' .
mr president , i voted against amendment no 54 which would have allowed a derogation from our yield limits on cigarettes exported to third countries .
all cigarettes are harmful .
none do any good .
smoking is an addiction , indeed a slow suicide , as we have voted , and manufacturers have admitted and known for some time that it causes cancer and other diseases .
i agree that third countries should set their own health rules but we should not approve of double standards .
if we choose tight protection for our citizens we should not allow the exporting of more dangerous products which profit from the addiction of others .
no man is an island .
all human beings are involved with each other .
i cannot condone profiting from the ill-health of third world citizens .
mr president , i wanted to give an explanation of vote stating that i had abstained on much of the maaten report .
when we start regulating the size , colour and position of notices and pictures on cigarette packets , then we are no longer the europe in which i believe .
i disagree with newton dunn ; it is not a question of double standards .
but we are responsible for the health of our citizens and we must decide on rules here .
other regions must decide on their own regulations .
we cannot have rules which damage exports , with the result that others will then export to these regions .
mr president , this is just a brief statement to declare that i do not totally agree with the maaten report either .
there are a whole range of activities connected to the tobacco industry , which we must protect at all costs .
mr president , i share this explanation of vote with mrs cauquil and mrs bordes .
this dilemma must be resolved in the interests of the credibility of community policy .
the european union must set itself the task of pursuing policies which our citizens can understand .
there is an irresolvable contradiction between the promotion of tobacco cultivation , on the one hand , and the advertising ban , on the other .
if this contradiction cannot be resolved at community level , then the union must fight to help attain a high level of health protection by supporting a reduction in tobacco cultivation at international level .
mr president , i have voted decidedly in favour of the amended proposal and of the legislative resolution with regard to the new tobacco directive .
it is certainly the case that the texts need to be cleaned up because we have adopted quite a few texts which , according to the rules of lawmaking , do not belong in this directive at all .
despite this , these texts too are of value because they send out a message .
they show that parliament puts public health first .
protecting public health is effectively our responsibility .
even if we harmonise legislation , public health should not be compromised in any way .
public health is not just any old interest , it is of general interest .
today , we have proved that we stand for this , and that is how it should be .
- it was important that the tobacco industry was not able to prevent the vote taking place in parliament today .
more than half a million people died as a result of tobacco addiction in the eu in 1990 .
despite huge lobbying by the tobacco industry , including an attempt to say the process is illegal , the european parliament will stand firm on public health .
i welcome the commitment to increase information in cigarette labelling .
health warnings will take up 40 % of the front of the packet and 50 % of the back .
the industry must be made to give details of the ingredients of the cigarettes , including the tobacco , and just as importantly the filters and additives used to make them .
each individual brand should list all additives , not just the prohibited ingredients .
this must be made public knowledge and not hidden behind a shroud of ' trade secrecy ' .
people have a right to accurate information on the health risks of tobacco .
the greens want to ban many of the more than 600 additives in cigarettes .
we need to know what these substances are and make sure that they are properly tested .
smokers have a right to know exactly what a cigarette contains .
. ( el ) no one denies the harmful effects of smoking and no one can object to measures being taken to reduce smoking .
from this point of view , the commission ' s proposal for a directive contains positive provisions .
we as legislators share the responsibility with the manufacturers of ensuring that the public is fully informed about the dangers of cigarette addiction .
the recommendations regarding warnings on the front of packages are to be welcomed because they shatter the myth that those products are less damaging to a person 's health .
- ( pt ) the debate and vote on this report revealed a clear divide between members .
as imports are not being prohibited , the american multinationals would be the only ones to gain from a reduction in the production and manufacture of tobacco in europe .
we also tabled a proposal intended to protect the portuguese brand ' português suave ' as we consider that there is no reason to threaten this .
- i voted in favour of lifting the ban on sales of oral tobacco , so called snuff , in the eu .
i totally understand that all tobacco products are dangerous to human health and cause different types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases .
however , i think that all tobacco products , which may have different levels of harmfulness , should be treated in a way that is compatible with the level of danger they represent to human health .
i also want the different restrictions to be based on scientific facts .
that is why i tabled an amendment with my colleagues to do the monitoring of health effects by the year 2002 instead of 2005 which was the initial proposal from the commission .
this proposal to change the timetable is also very important from the public health point of view .
unfortunately my proposal was not adopted .
- ( de ) i was the rapporteur in this house for the common organisation of the raw tobacco market over 30 years ago .
in the enthusiasm of youth , i hoped then to convince my 141 fellow members not to introduce a market organisation for raw tobacco which would give us mountains of unmarketable raw tobacco to deal with .
had i been listened to then , we would not now be crying over the billions spent on raw tobacco subsidies .
however , i am not trying here to come to terms with the past .
we have got them used to subsidies and that has , to all intents and purposes , destroyed our chances of restructuring the cultivation of raw tobacco .
there is no question that a lot of people in the eu and everywhere else in the world die from lung cancer , which hits far more smokers than non-smokers .
the suggestion that eu manufacturers should be required to comply with the same regulations as regards tar , nicotine and carbon monoxide yields for cigarettes intended for export to third countries is perverse in the extreme .
measures such as this would result in the relocation of 12 % of cigarette production in the tiny principality of luxembourg alone .
what is being produced here now is out of proportion and unfair to tobacco farmers and discriminates against the european tobacco industry .
one cannot shake off the impression that certain people in the health lobby would prefer to exile smokers altogether .
i am in favour of warnings on packets , but not in favour of a skull which takes up 60 % of the surface area .
i am in favour of a targeted information campaign , especially for young people , in order to make them aware of the dangers of smoking to their health .
but i am against all the exaggerations contained in this report and am therefore unable to vote in favour of the report as it stands .
- ( sv ) to impose a total ban on snuff in the eu , at the same time as cigarettes and other tobacco products are permitted throughout the union , is illogical .
the ban on snuff , which applies in all eu countries except for sweden , ought therefore to be lifted .
the advantage of snuff is that using it does not affect the environment .
while smoking causes suffering and illnesses even among people who do not smoke , especially among people with allergies , it is only the snuff taker himself who is exposed to possible ill effects .
snuff is addictive .
the tobacco industry should not , therefore , be allowed to market snuff as something healthy .
the marketing directive , which will shortly be banning tobacco advertising within the eu , must be safeguarded and apply to all tobacco products .
.
eplp members fully support the main direction of the maaten report in highlighting health risks associated with tobacco .
however , we believe that there are a number of technical areas which will need to be clarified following first reading in negotiation with the commission and council .
the question of tobacco growing subsidy has not been addressed in this report .
although many members feel it is part of the whole debate on tobacco and health and should have been included here , we believe that it would be more correctly brought up in reform of the cap .
. ( fr ) smoking kills : it causes 500 000 deaths every year in the european union , which is 1400 a day or almost one a minute .
one smoker in two will die , sooner or later , from a smoking-related disease .
these figures speak for themselves and are terrifying .
tobacco is not just like any other product .
it requires specific regulation and it is most apt , in light of recent studies , that the commission has proposed a revision of the legislative texts in this field .
although it may seem naïve to try to eradicate smoking , i think that we can certainly reduce it considerably by providing the consumer with better information .
we have just declared ourselves in favour , much to my satisfaction , of warnings that will cover 35 % of the front and 45 % of the back of the cigarette packet .
personally , i am sorry that most of my colleagues could not be convinced of the impact that photographs on these surfaces would have had .
i supported amendment no 75 on banning the sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 16 .
to the anti-prohibitionists , who feel that this ban would , on the contrary , make cigarettes more attractive to young people , i would answer with an ethical argument .
our society has the duty , in certain areas , to set strict moral limits .
it is the whole issue of human behaviour that is at stake here .
this also raises the whole issue of education and of health education in particular .
such education must be started at the earliest possible age , and i think that adolescence is an appropriate stage to instil in young people the limits that they must not transgress .
on the basis of ethical considerations , too , i feel it is reasonable to ban exports of products that we consider to be harmful to our own citizens to countries outside the union .
i voted in the strongest possible terms against amendment no 54 .
europe has other assets and other creative ways of finding export markets .
during yesterday ' s debate , some members raised the point that smoking kills more people than tuberculosis , aids or other infectious diseases .
this factor alone is sufficient reason for us to grasp this problem with both hands .
mr maaten ' s report is a step in the right direction , but is only one step , because the fight for life , for health , is an ongoing struggle that should engage us all .
moreover , we wish to abolish the peculiar tobacco derogation granted to greece .
sweden ought not , in the name of free trade and the internal market , to force snuff products upon other countries and peoples if they do not want them .
in the same way , the commission ought to have shown similar respect for swedish alcohol policy by having extended and made permanent sweden ' s 1994 derogation concerning private imports of alcohol .
. as member for a tobacco-producing region , i would like to express my reservations about the proposal for a ' tobacco ' directive .
nobody questions the validity of its aims : smoking kills 500 000 people per year in the european union alone .
we must therefore fight vigorously against smoking , just as we must fight unremittingly against drug addiction , alcoholism and all dangerous addictions , whether they are of natural or chemical origin .
in this respect , we can only share this report ' s proposals , which seek more effectively to warn , make aware and inform consumers of the risks to which they are exposing themselves through excessive tobacco consumption .
.
i wholeheartedly support amendments to the commission 's revised proposal on tobacco that will strengthen health warnings on cigarette packets in the eu .
the new cigarette health warnings will cover half the surface of cigarette packs , with warnings 40 % of the packet size on the front and 50 % on the back .
smoking kills and there is no nice way to put that .
half of all long-term smokers will eventually be killed by tobacco and of these , half will die during middle age losing 20 to 25 years of life .
as many as half a million people in europe are killed by tobacco , and 85 % of lung cancers are caused by smoking .
madam president , i would have welcomed the radical proposal to use pictures to illustrate the damage which smoking does to health , like they do in canada .
if shocking pictures of smoke-filled lungs or rotting teeth show the harmful effects of smoking , go ahead and print them on packs .
i am disappointed it was not accepted .
it is preposterous that tobacco companies are trying to destroy this legislation .
i am fed up with them trying to put a stop to these proposals .
they have misled people for far too long .
at present , warnings are cleverly hidden by displays or coloured packaging .
smokers or those considering smoking must know the full risks of their choice .
the proposal will ban the use of misleading terms such as ' ultra light ' and ' low tar ' .
people have been hooked on the idea that ' mild ' and ' low tar ' cigarettes are healthier .
this is simply not true .
low tar cigarettes cause just as much damage as normal cigarettes .
this legislation will spell out the dangers of smoking and save thousands of lives .
- ( de ) i voted against an export ban on stronger cigarettes for the following reasons :
the commission has proposed banning exports of cigarettes with yields of over 10 milligrammes of tar , 1 milligramme of nicotine and 10 milligrammes of carbon dioxide to third countries .
this would result in a massive erosion of eu cigarette exports and the loss of several tens of thousands of jobs .
this sort of ban benefits no one , because the cigarettes will simply be manufactured outside the eu .
but the jobs will be lost here .
the eu has absolutely no powers to enforce such a ban .
it has nothing to do with the internal single market .
the anti-tobacco fanatics should not act as if exporting cigarettes was tantamount to handing out cyanide .
the eu is acting inconsistently , given that it also subsidises the cultivation and export of tobacco to the tune of eur 1 billion .
the eu is using an export ban to act as the health missionary of the entire world .
that is presumptuous and offends the customs and practices of other countries .
the right move would be to promote the work on global uniform production standards for tobacco products already begun in the world health organisation .
unilateral action by the eu will be pointless .
berenguer fuster report ( a5-0142 / 2000 )
mr president , i voted for this report on the exchange on information regarding , specifically , financial activities .
the members of the pensioners ' party are not yet aware of how the money from contributions which should boost their pensions is spent .
i feel that this directive should be extended to include this type of inspection .
lulling report ( a5-0144 / 2000 )
therefore , this trade between one state and another which was caused by different levels of duties was only natural .
if we want to avoid it , we must remove all the excise duties in the european union .
the rapporteur , mrs lulling , strongly criticised the taxation of alcohol in finland in her report , which she considers to be unreasonably high . she also criticised the aim to restrict the importation of beer through derogation provisions .
in my opinion , the commission ' s proposal is a rather good compromise , however .
according to that proposal , finland would reserve the right to abolish the more stringent restrictions on imports from eu countries in stages by the end of 2003 .
imports of beer from non-member countries such as russia and estonia would be limited to six litres up to the year 2006 .
nowhere else on the eu ' s external borders is such cheap alcohol available than in those regions that border onto finland .
in my opinion , finland is consequently justified in maintaining more stringent restrictions on imports than other eu countries .
under the treaty of amsterdam , internal market policy also has to take into account considerations of public health and environmental protection .
derogations with regard to community legislation must be allowed if they are made on the basis of higher levels of health protection .
- ( sv ) finland has been hit by serious problems in the form of a drastic increase in the amount of beer imported from third countries , mainly from estonia and russia .
it is therefore a very positive development that the commission is now granting finland a six-year derogation to enable it to introduce a new limit on beer imports from third countries .
finland is in that way being granted the right to limit beer imports from third countries to six litres per traveller per day up until 1 january 2006 .
the commission might have shown similar insight in its treatment of the swedish derogations from 1994 concerning private imports of alcohol into sweden .
while finland is obtaining a new derogation , the swedish one is being removed .
vidal-quadras roca report ( a5-0159 / 2000 )
sadly , today , we have to come to terms with the fact that someone has prevented this from coming about .
and who was that ?
we should send the multibillion pound bill for decommissioning the nuclear industry to the person responsible , although i still do not know who that is .
maybe you can enlighten me , mr president .
. ( fr ) the purpose of the programme that we have been debating today is to organise the dismantling of the joint research centre ' s nuclear installations and the management of waste resulting from their nuclear activities .
i do not have any major disagreement with the basic proposal , but i do have questions about this programme ' s budget , and the rapporteur has not provided us with any practical proposals on this .
it is true that he rejected the proposal by the european commission .
let us remember that the commission proposed that it would finance this operation by using , at the end of each year , unspent appropriations from heading 3 .
to this end , it would use a ' reception ' line under the current sub-section b4 , which covers energy , the monitoring of nuclear safety and the environment .
this solution may be satisfactory insofar as it places financing outside the framework programmes for research , a point stressed by the european parliament , but it nevertheless falls short of what is required .
we cannot accept the long-term financing of the dismantling of nuclear activities through a ' miscellaneous ' line , of an order which is left to chance .
i must take this opportunity to say that i do not approve of the growing frequency with which we resort to this type of line !
i imagine that this is what led the rapporteur to " take note " of the commission ' s proposal , without actually putting it into practice .
the report proposes that we establish a trialogue between the institutions in order to reach a solution but says nothing about the alternative means for financing that have been suggested .
the most mistaken course of action would therefore be to have the dismantling of these nuclear activities financed by member states , by methods that still remain to be found .
that would inevitably cause a backlash in the countries that are not greatly affected by this problem .
on the other hand , the most suitable solution is the one that seeks to have this programme financed by a self-contained budget line .
i am quite aware that it is not the easiest solution , because it involves voting for additional appropriations in the review of the financial perspectives .
nevertheless , we must provide ourselves with the means to achieve our ambitions , particularly when we are talking about nuclear activity .
in the long term , then , we will have to put pressure on the council to accept the creation of this self-contained budget line .
in the shorter term , for pragmatic reasons , we should not obstruct the rapid implementation of this programme .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m. )
special un conference : women 2000
the next item is the council and the commission statements on the outcome of the special un session on ' women 2000 : gender equality , development and peace ' .
mr president , i am grateful for this opportunity to tell you about the work carried out at the special un conference assessing the 1995 beijing conference and its action platform .
as usually happens with this type of international instrument , it became necessary to assess this given that five years had passed since it was signed .
there was also , for the first time , a more positive reference to issues of maternity and paternity , usually associated with the male role , and the need for job-sharing .
on health , the need was noted for a holistic approach in terms of sexual rights and not just in the area of reproductive health .
special references were introduced , also on the eu ' s initiative , to handicapped migrant women , elderly women and native women .
the role of men was adequately emphasised , as also was the need to reinforce the participation of women in building increasingly peaceful societies .
discussions were also held on reinforcing the role of non-governmental organisations in conducting all the policies and as privileged partners of the state in ensuring that the platform is implemented .
mr president , i am very pleased to be here today to give you the commission 's view on the outcome of last week 's extremely important conference in new york .
i want to apologise for the fact that my colleague , commissioner diamantopoulou , is unable to be here this afternoon .
as some of you will know , she was unavoidably delayed by commitments which she had undertaken before the timing of this debate .
members will be able to follow up any further details in that exchange with commissioner diamantopoulou next week .
we should also thank parliament for its exceptionally cooperative approach to the special session .
members of the committee on women 's rights and equal opportunities made an extremely valuable contribution as part of the delegation .
however , beyond that , they took the initiative in cooperating with parliamentarians from the member states and from associated countries .
that was an exceptionally useful piece of political coordination .
we in the commission also very much welcome parliament 's motion for a resolution : it is a firm , constructive statement of parliament 's commitment to gender equality .
the european union can be proud that it was the most progressive regional group represented at new york .
collectively we fought hard to move forward from beijing .
if we succeeded , it is due in part to the unity of purpose demonstrated by the various institutions .
and succeed , i think we can say , we certainly did !
we managed that without having to concede any watering down of the beijing platform in other areas .
the document reaffirms women 's rights as human rights .
it urges all un members to sign the cedaw optional protocol and calls for a strong awareness of gender issues in the workings of the international criminal court .
it recognises that discrimination against women is often compounded by discrimination on other grounds .
while we did not obtain specific references to all the grounds listed in the ec treaty , the presidency made the european union position clear in a final statement before the general assembly .
we have new , much clearer language on the state 's duty to end violence against women , including domestic violence , and to put an end to the appalling yet growing traffic in women .
the outcome document acknowledges the link between gender equality and greater prosperity .
if women are given a chance to participate fully in social and economic life they will be better able to pull themselves and their communities out of poverty .
it seems to me , with some responsibilities in this field , inconceivable to have a sustainable model of economic development which does not have gender issues at its heart .
the document reaffirms the prime importance of education as a means of empowering girls and women .
it also refers to the need for a fair distribution of work between men and women , including work in the home , and for measures to make it easier to reconcile work with family care commitments .
it also has something to say on methodology - how , in other words , to ensure that these fine intentions are put into practice .
at the european union 's insistence the document recognises the importance of establishing benchmarks and progress indicators .
lastly , we welcome the reference to men 's role in bringing about greater gender equality for they clearly have a considerable responsibility as well .
the union is better equipped than ever to deliver on its beijing commitments with its stronger stand on human rights , gender equality and discrimination .
the amsterdam treaty gives the union increased scope to push ahead with implementation of the beijing platform for action .
i hope nobody will doubt the commission 's determination to do precisely that .
the effort is of course led by my colleague , commissioner diamantopoulou , but it is an endeavour in which all of us as commissioners wish to be fully involved .
mr president , i thank the commission , the presidency and all my fellow delegates for the excellent cooperation which we have enjoyed and which has greatly impacted on the conference .
the conference has shown that , over the past couple of years , we have indeed made progress and we have done so in many areas .
as such , we can trace the progress that has been made , although new problems have emerged in the meantime , of course .
i am thinking of the problem of aids in women . in some african towns and cities , up to 40 % of pregnant women suffer from aids .
there is also the problem of trafficking in women , rape of women during armed conflicts , etc .
consequently , beijing + 5 could not afford to just focus on the progress that was made in respect of decisions taken at beijing .
beijing + 5 also had to incorporate a number of new issues into the text , which it did , after a hard fight .
in my opinion , we have three tasks within the european union .
firstly , as a european union , we should remain the driving force behind the member states .
we played this role very distinctly in the past and we must continue to do so in future .
it will be evident from the fifth action programme and the financial resources used for this purpose whether the european commission is serious about applying the beijing platform in years to come .
but it is not only vis-à-vis our own member states that we have a role to play , we also have a responsibility towards the candidate countries , those which we as meps have brought together in new york .
we have proposed to continue the cooperation with them and asked the commission , during the screening activities it carries out in the context of the acquis communautaire , to assess the achievements with regard to the beijing platform too .
we also have a role to play vis-à-vis third countries .
it is dreadful to have to listen to the problems which women face in third countries : genital mutilation , killing if they have been unfaithful or if they had sexual relations before marriage and all these kinds of problems .
it is the most atrocious form of violence perpetrated against women .
in my opinion , the aid which the european union grants to third countries should definitely be conditional on what these third countries need to do in order to solve the problems faced by women .
finally , i would like to make it clear that i am a catholic , but an open-minded catholic .
i was greatly shocked by the news that the church which i belong to has associated itself with the most fundamentalist groups which exist in society .
it was shocking , mainly because my church offers so few opportunities to women within its own structures .
mr president , the european union brought women ' s rights throughout the world to the fore in new york .
that is most unusual , so here too special thanks .
and fruitful collaboration with non-governmental organisations also strengthened the position of the european union .
our unity allowed our opinion to prevail in the progressive countries and to make significant progress in the twelve crucial areas .
as already mentioned , we have the fundamentalist countries of iran , iraq , libya , sudan and even the vatican to thank for that .
but this should not blind us to the fact that we really moved forward with women ' s rights in new york and made significant progress in the areas already mentioned .
the fight against violence was put on every country ' s agenda .
access to capital , the role of men - very important , we would like to see more men taking part in the process - still need to be promoted .
we tabled our document , our report , in new york as an official un document , another major success .
i think the resolutions of parliament and our progress in the european union , parliament ' s progress , are now accessible to every country .
we were very successful with the initiative to invite parliamentarians twice and have speeded up the implementation of the action platform .
we came to the clear conclusion with our partners from associated countries that we need to work together more closely in order to promote women ' s rights .
we want to have a parliamentarians ' conference in two years to review beijing .
we insist on another world women ' s conference in five years to ensure that the process continues .
we must all make a joint effort to ensure that the subject of gender mainstreaming , equal opportunities for men and women , stars on the world political agenda .
it is in our interest to fight for this .
i think , and this is my personal opinion , that it is also in our interest to fight to ensure that this happens in eastern europe .
mr president , commissioner , i would like to start by saying that i am pleased with the outcome of the special un conference on ' women 2000 : gender equality , development and peace ' .
progress has been made , that is for sure , as has already been mentioned by previous speakers .
the distribution in care , actions against trafficking in women and empowerment of women are important issues to me .
i am pleased that the participating countries still subscribe to the beijing declaration and the action plan .
but back to europe .
in my opinion , it is downright alarming that it is precisely the candidate countries which have shown a decline in the number of female employees and the number of girls registered in education .
this development merits particular attention from us in the european parliament .
we should point out to the acceding countries that they need to improve this situation .
the other point i wanted to raise is the opposition from the islamic and asian countries with regard to women ' s rights , in connection with which they refer to the sharia .
i find it downright disgraceful that we women cannot join forces across the world .
i would ask you to give attention to this .
it is not just the islamic and asian countries to which this applies , but also poland , for example .
they need to be involved in this process .
at the end of the day , we are relying on the political will of society as a whole to commit itself to a cause which is related to democracy and human rights and which transcends all cultures and religions .
mr president , i am not now asking for an extra minute in the name of equality , however ; i shall try to keep to two minutes .
i will join that group of people who just said that real progress was made on many issues at the new york conference .
it is the very determined work of the european union we have to thank for that .
we were there as observers , but it is to be hoped that we were also able to influence the way the talks went - at least in some respect .
it was especially gratifying for me that all the member states and almost all the candidate countries were talking together under portugal ' s leadership .
this is a promising sign that we will also be able to strengthen legislation on equality within the context of the european union .
i myself do not remember seeing such single-mindedness , and for that thanks go to the chairman and , obviously , the commission as well .
i would appeal to commissioner patten that when enlargement negotiations are being conducted , serious attention be paid to poland ' s compliance with eu legislation on equality and its recognition of women ' s rights .
i believe this conference has given hope to all those millions of women who are without fundamental human rights ; and we need a further follow-up conference in five years ' time .
mr president , i should like to thank the presidency .
i did not participate directly in the new york conference , but the reports i have heard , from participants and in other ways , have really praised the european union as being very much a motor of progressive change .
i think that , happily enough , we can declare the beijing platform for action a success .
if there is anything which really has had a very secure foundation , it is very much this platform that has been adopted .
we saw this from the assessment , showing a host of committed women around the world working not only on a small scale but also on an extremely large scale where , for example , violence against women is concerned .
i should also like to thank mrs smet .
i do not belong to any church and come from a country which has now also separated the church from the state .
i want to thank all practising catholics who are dissociating themselves from the vatican state , which is behaving as it is .
if we cannot enter into dialogue with the vatican state in the future , we shall probably have to question its basis for existence .
knowledge of new technologies has been considered to be of great importance in terms of allowing full participation in the society of the future .
the media is of enormous importance as it can allow women ' s voices to be heard , and can transmit an image , without stereotypes , which is committed to society and the quest for solutions to everyday problems .
one of the objectives is the eradication of domestic violence , which will be considered as a public issue and therefore subject to national legislation .
violence against women and girls will be punishable by law , which means that there will have to be legislative reforms in the countries where it is not yet considered a crime .
all these objectives must be achieved in the next few years and , in order to ensure they are complied with , we are requesting a new meeting within the next five years .
the fifth programme for equality promoted by the european commission must serve to promote the position of women , to eliminate the remaining inequalities , integrating gender policies into all community programmes .
this meeting has therefore been of enormous importance in terms of making progress in the situation of women in all parts of the world .
mr president , i want to thank the council of ministers and the commission for their respective interventions .
the women ' s conference at the un in new york came perilously close to failing .
a small group of catholic and islamic fundamentalist countries clearly intended to undermine the progress achieved by women from around the world in beijing five years ago .
the issues which created the most problems were women ' s rights to sex education , free abortion and safe sex in order to protect themselves against hiv and aids .
these issues united certain islamic and catholic countries ranging all the way from the sudan , iran and libya to the vatican , nicaragua and poland , which were prime movers in the fight against these rights .
some countries attempted to quash wordings about governments ' responsibility to protect women from various forms of violence .
i should like to point out that the presidency of the eu , especially the minister mrs de belém roseira , actively contributed to a successful final outcome , something we would thank her for .
the final document embodies progress in certain respects .
forced marriages and murders committed for reasons of honour are mentioned for the first time in an agreed international document .
on the issues of rape within marriage , right of possession and right of inheritance , together with the right to asylum on the grounds of gender-based persecution , the wordings have been strengthened .
women ' s right to equal participation in macro-economic decision-making , together with the allocation of quotas with a view to increasing women ' s participation in political parties and parliaments are other matters which are being taken up .
the resolution we are to vote on demands that the institutions of the eu , member states and candidate states make active efforts to turn the final document from beijing + 5 into a reality .
it is especially important that all candidate states , including poland , undertake to abide by the eu ' s policy on women ' s rights .
what are now required are economic resources for putting the decisions into effect and inspection tools for supervising their implementation .
mr president , the beijing + 5 conference has not actually made any significant progress in achieving the aims defined in the beijing 1995 action programme .
the women ' s march for equal opportunities and the affirmation of differences still has a long way to go and is effectively full of dangerous paths .
however , it must , of course , be appreciated - as commissioner patten said , moreover - that the conference as a whole confirmed and consolidated women ' s rights as human rights .
i welcome the positive contribution made by europe to forging closer relationships with other countries and the ngos .
an example of this , and this is an appeal to the council , is the issue of wage discrimination .
it has been demonstrated that , compared to men doing the same work , women receive 50 or up to 80 per cent less .
this is not in our legislation . nevertheless , it appears that the european union approves of it .
i wonder if the portuguese presidency , before the end of its mandate , could make a recommendation in this respect .
why does the commission and the european union , given such a positive assessment , not implement these programmes so that the european union may also offer its women with no resources the possibility of these policies ?
please answer me , mr patten .
mr president , the european parliament ' s delegation played a magnificent role with regard to the candidate countries .
our work has been outstanding in this respect .
i do have reservations with regard to poland , but precisely because parliament ' s delegation played such a significant role .
mr varaut , you are very badly informed . you have made a fool of yourself .
you were not in new york , but i was .
your information is not accurate . it is not even true .
your intervention is very unfortunate because it is false .
i have to refute what you have said because none of it is true .
it has already been said many times : the work carried out by the un and in new york has demonstrated clearly that some progress has been made since beijing .
women are no longer regarded as merely vulnerable people who need to be protected but as the social protagonists of change and as an essential part of society ' s resources .
the need has become clear for governments to include a gender aspect in all government policies , from employment to development , from social policies to the fight against violence .
there is an evident need to continue to step up dialogue and cooperation with autonomous women ' s organisations in civil society , politics and the institutions .
a number of challenges remain at national and international levels and for the european union , particularly in the context of its development cooperation policy .
in this regard , i would like to draw commissioner patten ' s attention to the commission ' s frequently negligent attitude towards the adoption of drafts which provide for the involvement of women on development cooperation with mediterranean countries .
poverty affects women more than anybody else .
therefore , we need to focus on clear policies which fight the social exclusion of women and consolidate their role as active protagonists of political change and economic development .
if globalisation is to provide new opportunities , it must include globalisation of the human rights of all people , globalisation of fairness and globalisation of equal opportunities .
development must be regarded as a project to expand the freedoms which all human beings have the right to enjoy .
therefore , the need for recognition of rights without any discrimination must be a priority both for us and for the international organisations .
mr president , the world conference on women , which was held five years ago , meant a breakthrough at the time in the worldwide recognition of women ' s rights as an area of human rights autonomy and empowerment .
in contrast to this , i have mixed feelings about the un conference which was held in new york last week .
this is greatly disappointing .
actual equality and freedom for women is only possible if all options are open to them and if the traditional family image is not held up to them as the only true one .
resistance of the kind displayed by governments , diplomats and officials last week , is a form of rearguard action , however .
it is impossible to stop a revolution with clever word games and little schemes behind the scenes .
the fight goes on .
the european union and member state representatives showed great commitment during the conference to the issue of sexual self-determination for women and the non-discrimination principle pursuant to article 13 .
the fact that this did not end up in the final document should not be a reflection on them .
article 13 offers the opportunity to do so and the beijing + 5 conference issued an instruction to this effect .
mr president , on a point of order .
many friends and women who are colleagues in this parliament have just pointed out that my name appears as one of those who signed against women 's rights .
i want to put on record that i am not against women 's rights .
i have always supported women 's rights .
it must be an error .
sometimes colleagues bring petitions from delegations and we sign them .
i am sorry about that .
that was not a point of order , mr khanbhai .
you mentioned a matter which has not been raised by anyone . there has been no reference during the debate either to your name or to a list of reprobates .
i really do not know what you are talking about .
anyone at the un last week , like myself , would know that , in the end , we only managed to approve less than one-third of the final document . the difficulties were immense .
finally , i must say that the european union has a decisive role to play in this issue .
we must lead the way in defending women ' s rights and we must continue the work in this respect .
the resolution approved by the european parliament was greatly appreciated in the un .
mr president , i must thank the members for all their compliments on the presidency ' s work .
i am extremely grateful to everyone for this .
when i spoke , it was clearly on behalf of all the member states of the european union and of all the applicant countries except for poland .
in the contacts established with poland , it has been made very clear that accession cannot be exchanged for non-recognition of women ' s rights .
the european union could not take any other position on such an issue . women will no longer accept their fundamental rights being regarded as a bargaining chip for political issues .
europe must continue to be the driving force in developments in this area .
we must take advantage of all these opportunities .
these developments must also be achieved through benchmarking processes and by using the conclusions of the lisbon special summit , which considered that in europe there could be no economic development without social cohesion .
in this way the european union itself can develop and export these instruments for assessing , measuring and exchanging good practices enabling gradual and effective progress to be made .
i referred to the portuguese presidency ' s work on the issue of discrimination in the european union .
portugal is also very pleased that , in the last social affairs and employment council , a resolution was approved on reconciling family and professional life .
women are constantly being penalised because the time that they devote to family life gives employers objective reasons to discriminate against them in wage terms .
therefore , in my opinion , we have already achieved what was asked of us .
finally , i must thank the president and the whole house for your kindness and the comments which you have made , and i also thank the commission for its support .
thank you , president of the council . we all share this hope .
the debate is closed .
i have received four motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
the commissioner was entitled to give a speech in the plenary session .
even in the working parties , we were not allowed to take the floor , which was always given to the portuguese presidency .
do not , therefore , put words into the mouths of the members of this parliament who were in new york .
what were banned from these meetings were the positions that parliament adopted under the smet / gröner report , and nothing else .
mr president , poland ' s name has been bandied about a great deal , so i must say that we simply stated that poland is accepting the acquis communautaire .
if poland tells us that it is free ...
you may hear my explanation of vote tomorrow , mr president , if you are going to cut me off .
mrs lulling , we have already heard speeches on the matter from the president of the council and from the commissioner on the subject of poland .
you were speaking about a point of order .
mr izquierdo rojo had already replied to mr varaut and therefore , mrs lulling , you could not use your speech on a point of order to discuss the issue .
you have , of course , prompted mr varaut to ask to take the floor for personal reasons .
you are quite right , mr president .
in short , i agree completely with the need for a full debate in this chamber , even if we do not all agree .
to conclude , i have heard many things said about the vatican , but i can see that jesuitical thinking , at least , has truly pervaded the european parliament .
the corridors are there specifically for private , informal conversations , not official debates .
tunisia - human rights - eu-tunisia agreement
in fact , tunisia is the first country with which the european union signed an association agreement within the context of the 1995 barcelona process .
we attach great importance to preserving and consolidating this agreement , and i would like to make it quite clear that , as far as we are concerned , there is no question about this .
and this is the moment to do so .
this is why we call upon the commission and the council to support this process by joining us in making representations to the tunisian authorities .
it is also based on shared values , on respect for cultural , religious and linguistic differences , and on policies capable of producing prosperity and security for the entire mediterranean area .
today , may this debate serve to remind us and our partners of all these things .
why is europe silent about human rights in tunisia ?
is it on account of the stability and economic progress which this holiday destination enjoys ?
is it because of the political links with france or the european socialists ?
or because it has adopted a constructive stance in the peace process in the middle east ?
or do we see tunisia mainly as a bulwark against the rise of islamic fundamentalism ?
at any rate , president ali only has the religious fanatics in mind .
he seems to be obsessed by them .
but this concern is more of an alibi than a justification for the human rights situation in his country .
not only muslim fundamentalists , but all political opponents are systematically silenced .
tunisia calls itself a democracy , a democracy without opposition that is , without freedom of the press , without fair judicial processes and with torture and the elimination of political prisoners and their families .
tunisia has concluded an association agreement with the european union which contains a clear human rights clause .
there can , of course , be no question of president ben ali ' s claiming rights under the agreement but shirking his obligations under it .
if the violations continue , the treaty will unfortunately need to be suspended .
would commissioner patten agree with me there ?
tunisia is the first mediterranean sea partner with which this association agreement has been concluded .
given its economic development , it can act as a model for the entire region , but it should then , of course , meet the political criteria .
the european union cannot allow one agreement partner that which it denies another .
the association council must , therefore , look into the human rights situation as a matter of great urgency and draft a democratisation programme .
if the european union keeps quiet any longer , it will be partly responsible for the human rights violations in tunisia .
they therefore asked for understanding and patience .
i must say that the tunisian government has made gestures which indicate goodwill . they made these gestures during our visit and this is reflected in the report which the delegation has presented to parliament .
this is the message which this house must send to the tunisian authorities , who must receive them in the positive light in which they are intended .
to this end , within the framework of euro-mediterranean cooperation , the commission , the council and parliament must not go into reverse with regard to the aid programmes which must be implemented within the framework of meda ii .
education and training in democratic principles are a fundamental element of sustaining a plural and democratic society .
young people , judges , the police and journalists need to have full knowledge of the rights they must exercise and defend .
this is the area in which the european union can and must cooperate .
it also concerns me that commissioner patten , who is present , is not sufficiently sensitive to the serious problems currently faced on the southern side of the mediterranean , where tunisia plays a very important role .
emigration , fundamentalism , poverty and political instability cannot be resolved by pronouncements and good intentions alone .
we need true political will and the economic and human resources to put it into practice .
in any event - and this could serve as a summary of the debate - we cannot restrict our cooperation with third countries to purely trade and economic issues .
we also believe that we need a common strategy in the mediterranean , as the resolution states , and that , together with political , social and security aspects , special attention is paid to the cultural and human dimension .
this is why we need to strengthen the interparliamentary dialogue and the dialogue with the representatives of civil society .
as we say in my country , by talking we come to understand people ' .
if one thing characterises the people of the mediterranean , it is the wealth of their thought and their words , and that , ladies and gentlemen , costs very little .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , when we start to examine an issue like this we should remind ourselves of the european union ' s general attitude to its external relations .
the eu has a set of values and principles which it naturally tries to promote in its relations and which it tries to use in all areas of its associations with third countries .
we do not work in this way .
naturally , it has also noted the considerable concerns expressed here today .
the council has on several occasions emphasised to the tunisian authorities its concern about the occurrence of certain situations , particularly the lack of general freedom and press freedom in particular .
at the moment this dialogue is centred specifically on the current reforms of the new press law , the operation and functions of the penalty enforcement judge and the amendments of electoral law .
the possibility of such a dialogue , which tunisia did refuse for some time , represents significant progress .
he underlined the constant need to respect fundamental freedoms .
we realise that any kind of action in terms of political pressure can have advantages where carried out through the media .
we believe that there is room for several dimensions to be used in the international arena on this type of issue and we do not reject the efficacy of these actions .
however , the council prefers to use the opportunities for influencing the tunisian authorities more discreetly , and perhaps more effectively , by maintaining constructive pressure on them through political dialogue and various meetings at different levels .
maintaining regular dialogue and continuing all the steps which have been made so far , when and if appropriate , is the right way to proceed in this context .
despite these difficulties and the problems in moving this process forward which we all recognise , we must accept that there have been positive results .
the commission has also tried to finance actions in order to promote human rights and democracy in tunisia through the meda programme for democracy and may provide further information in this respect .
finally , in the barcelona declaration , tunisia , like the other mediterranean partner countries , signed up to certain principles involving respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
a measured policy is , in our opinion , the best way to achieve these objectives .
the council will continue to pursue discreet but firm diplomacy and will continue its policy of encouraging all forms of progress towards democracy and the rule of law .
i am extremely grateful to the house for the opportunity to comment on these extremely important matters .
as a number of honourable members have noted , mr taoufik ben brik 's hunger strike is over , but it has had a major impact both on the authorities in tunisia and on civil society .
it sparked a public debate in tunisia on the human rights situation in that country .
but how can the commission and the european union in general influence tunisia 's rate of progress in this area ?
this is best done by looking at the three main instruments provided by the association agreement linking the european union to tunisia .
the first , to which my colleague referred , is political dialogue .
this dialogue has already given us the opportunity to comment on tunisia 's human rights situation twice at ministerial level at the two association councils that have taken place to date .
the union has made a point of addressing the human rights issues in tunisia in our many contacts with the tunisian authorities .
the second instrument is the financing of positive measures in the form of grants from the community budget for projects promoting the exercise of political and civil rights .
the meda programme for democracy , on which parliament has strong and positive views , has financed training , information and awareness-raising projects for ngos and for public opinion in this field .
a programme of support for the tunisian media has already been included in the programming of future financial cooperation with tunisia and should be the subject of necessary consultations with the tunisian government .
as mr dupuis reminded us , sustainable economic development and political stability depend , above all , from russia to the mediterranean , on strong institutions , not on strong men .
it sometimes requires strong men to ensure that the institutions themselves are strong and operate within the rule of law .
the third instrument is the european union 's option of adopting restrictive measures , the most radical of which would obviously be the suspension of cooperation .
the commission considers that , before having recourse to any restrictive measures , positive means offered by the partnership should be pursued to the limit .
there is still significant scope both at the level of political dialogue and the financing of support programmes .
i would like to explore this further with tunisia .
specifically , the commission wishes to see to what extent the tunisian government will implement its promises regarding reform of the press code and facilitating freedom of association .
we also wish to see if our efforts to support the desired reforms by providing funding from the community budget prove successful .
i will keep parliament informed of developments in all these areas .
the issues that we have been discussing this afternoon are extremely important .
i know that parliament is aware of the whole picture .
mrs napoletano , in her interesting address , pointed out the economic and social progress that has been made in tunisia .
others could have referred , for example , to the position of tunisia on the sharia law .
nevertheless , there are issues which give considerable cause for concern .
it is best at the moment to proceed by dialogue but , as the house will understand , i do not equate dialogue with being supine .
parliament has legitimate concerns and a strongly felt point of view . that can be expressed firmly but courteously , as parliament is doing today .
i want to put the debate on tunisia in context and to take up a point that was made by mr hernández mollar and some other honourable members as well .
of course there will be events and developments that crowd in on us .
today , inevitably , we have to give a good deal of attention to our efforts to rebuilding in the balkans and , in particular , to prevent further social and political disintegration .
it is a policy in south-east europe which , i should add , is not irrelevant to stability and prosperity in the mediterranean .
but if i have to judge where we are going to face the main challenge in the medium and longer term , it would be , to be candid , our policy in and around the mediterranean .
what is at the heart of the union 's common foreign and security policy ?
it is the projection of stability .
that is the crucial element in our policy in the mediterranean .
what are we trying to do there ?
it is true that we are trying to create , if you like , the mediterranean equivalent of nafta .
but there is more than that , which i will come to in a moment .
i just want to make it clear to the honourable member that my commitment to making this policy a success is total .
one of the things that most offends me at the moment is that our record in supporting it through development assistance is not nearly as good as it should have been .
that is what i would like to be taken as a mark of whether or not we are committed to making a success of our policy in the mediterranean .
it is extremely important that we use our existing instruments much more competently , much more effectively .
that is what i would like to be judged on .
i want to repeat : this is not just about creating a free trade area , important as that may be .
free trade is not the end ; free trade is a means to an end .
it is an enormously important part of europe 's endeavours over the next few years ; as important , in some ways in projecting stability , as the whole process of enlargement .
i very much hope that in the next five years we will be able to carry that programme forward in tunisia and the rest of the region .
i could not hope to emulate the crushing brevity of this , in my view , brilliant journalistic comment .
however , my question is practically the same . why are we arguing about the situation in tunisia ?
there is a great paradox in tunisia at the moment and my concern is that this paradox may be becoming increasingly dangerous .
tunisia is the most peaceful and prosperous country of the maghreb , but also has the most closed press and media in the maghreb .
believe me , i am sensitive to the question of human rights .
i have spent fifteen years of my life without a passport or driving licence .
a lot is at stake , not only in tunisia , but also in the whole of the region , when it comes to achieving the objectives of this task .
mr president , the paradoxes of this parliament never cease to amaze us .
i would say that the results that tunisia has achieved make a good case for the country and that is why the trial it is being subjected to seems somewhat disproportionate given the reality of the situation .
we must , in any event , remember that tunisia was in the front line of combat when , a few years ago , muslim fundamentalism threatened the whole of the maghreb .
mr president , the news reached me here in strasbourg of a hunger strike involving more than one thousand political prisoners in tunisia .
i would like to make two comments .
based on christian beliefs , we denounce this ultimate means of self-defence .
however , we are quick to add our condemnation of authorities which force their citizens into such extreme despair .
the present tunisian regime does not tolerate any independent minds .
hence the repression which has lasted for years and is even becoming increasingly harsh .
this is why i wholeheartedly concur with those who submitted oral questions today , particularly mr van den bos .
he is quite right in asking the council for real action because the eu ' s own credibility as a partner of the association agreement with tunisia is in the balance .
if tunisians lead this fight , then the european union should not and cannot trail behind .
isolation would not pay off and would be likely to undermine the endeavours of those who are working in tunisia to improve the quality of its democracy .
mr president , human rights are being infringed .
there is no respect for press freedom and the rights to freedom of expression and of organisation , all of which are being ignored .
this is something we know about .
it is also known about in tunisia , both by the authorities and the people .
naturally , we shall be taking up these violations and criticising them whenever we have the opportunity to do so .
this is an extremely serious matter .
it is a question of universal rights , not only inside but also outside the european union , and there must be criticism when such rights are infringed .
i think that the best way of levelling criticism is by means of dialogue .
i saw that they are attempting to boost their economy in order to avoid further migration which could certainly affect relations between the mediterranean countries and the countries which are now part of the same european union as well .
i personally witnessed cultural exchanges taking place between universities and saw that the country is regaining a strong cultural identity and is committed to restoring historic town centres , rural tourism and craft trades .
i noted the high level of involvement of schools in educational programmes with a series of interdisciplinary activities .
and i saw absolutely no evidence pointing to an absence of associationism .
on the contrary : very strong , living associationism exists between young people and women , in particular , and there is also a remarkable spirit of partnership between institutions .
i learned from a question that we are lamenting the fact that the local press refuses to report cases of human rights abuse .
well then , i do not feel that the situation is so bad .
mr president , mr president-in-office , commissioner , most members here in this house - with the exception of the member who has just spoken - are concerned about developments in friendly , neighbouring tunisia .
tunisia is our neighbour , because the mediterranean does not divide , it unites us .
these concerns , as expressed here today , are not born of a colonial or neo-colonial attitude .
we are not talking about unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of a third country .
no , we are talking , as commissioner patten has stressed again and again , about critical dialogue based on the agreements which we have signed with tunisia .
it would therefore make no sense to cancel these agreements .
on the contrary , we must use them to shape this critical dialogue .
we are talking about creating a common area of security , stability and peace , and that includes democracy , that includes respect for human rights , that includes freedom of the press .
when tunisia keeps insisting that we are also talking about fighting extremism and terrorism and preventing extremist views , attitudes and organisations , then i agree with it wholeheartedly .
but how else is this fight best fought , if not through democracy ?
this is also being demonstrated by tunisia ' s neighbours .
which is why we cannot do without it .
tunisia keeps saying that it is a question of economic and social development .
but this totally positive economic and social development in tunisia is precisely the best basis for developing democracy still further and fighting the fight against extremism on democratic soil .
one last comment : we want to help tunisia , about that there can be no doubt .
we must help tunisia , just as we must help the whole area , the whole region .
the balkans are not our only priority .
the enlargement of the european union is not our only priority .
the mediterranean is not in the third division , it has equal status and importance .
but we must do that all together and sensitively .
we must do it in a way which does not repulse our mediterranean partners but which invites them back into the fold .
mr president , i have two brief comments to make .
this common strategy has formed part of the portuguese presidency ' s programme and may constitute an added value in the barcelona process .
it contains some extremely important elements for reorganising and siting the whole external policy of the eu in this area in a more integrated manner .
at the last general affairs council we made an effort to deal with this issue which has some delicate aspects given that these questions are complex and multi-dimensional .
the extraordinary general affairs council , which will be held immediately before the european council in santa maria da feira , will allow this common strategy to be approved .
this strategy will surely form an element which will greatly assist the eu ' s overall action , particularly within the common foreign and security policy , in respect of the whole mediterranean region .
mr president , i shall be even briefer than i was going to be , because the presidency has just answered one of the points put by mr ducarme .
i just want to touch on two other points he raised .
if the honourable member needs more information on tunisia or on the barcelona process as a whole , i hope he will let me know and i shall try to oblige as rapidly as possible .
thank you , commissioner patten .
i have received six motions for resolutions in accordance with rule 40 ( 5 ) .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .
china 's accession to wto
the next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions :
b5-0489 / 00 by mr westendorp y cabeza , on behalf of the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , to the council , on china ' s accession to the wto ;
b5-0490 / 00 by mr westendorp y cabeza , on behalf of the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , to the commission , on china ' s accession to the wto .
in this regard , i would like to make a comment and two requests .
secondly , this agreement is positive because it brings with it economic , social , environmental and also geopolitical advantages for china and the world in general , especially the european union .
another additional advantage is that china , through its entry into the world trade organisation , will be subject to its rules .
therefore , we also fully support the commission and council initiative to relaunch the round , which was frustrated at the outset in seattle , as soon as possible , turning it into a global round .
those have been my comments . my two questions are as follows :
the other question is as follows : we have worked very well with the commission and the council throughout this process and we intend to continue to do so .
i believe that this cooperation gives legitimacy to a process which is being criticised . the question is clear .
more than a question , it is a request : at the end of the process , will the agreement with china be subject to the approval of parliament ?
i believe that this hypothesis does not put the council or the commission at any risk , since its success is guaranteed .
as i have said , parliament supports this agreement .
furthermore , we will all gain in terms of democratic legitimacy with this important agreement , since , i do not need to stress , it is laid down that in important agreements parliament has a decisive role to play .
the integration of a partner with the economic and political size of china into the multilateral trade system will undoubtedly form one of the most important factors in the world economy at the beginning of this new century .
mr westendorp y cabeza mentioned the size of the chinese population and market and the importance which this will have in terms of the internal balance of the wto .
the universal vocation of the wto will therefore be reinforced and the discussions on the ways of making its operation more effective will from now on be an absolutely essential exercise .
at the level of the wto , the bilateral negotiations now occurring are just one step towards the multilateralisation of the agreed mechanisms and towards the finalisation of the process in geneva .
this requires the group ' s work towards accession to be continued in terms of the final wording of the respective protocol .
the evidence shows that the mandate was broad enough , even too broad for some countries , including mine , which had certain concerns about establishing this mandate .
it is therefore of the greatest importance that the chinese authorities carry out the necessary adaptations internally .
china ' s accession will constitute a stability factor in the world economy and will give increased importance to the next round of wto negotiations which we hope can start as soon as possible .
for this reason we must all make an effort to ensure that this objective is achieved .
however , the next speaker will probably know more about this than i do .
first , i should like to endorse in the most glowing terms possible the encomium that he delivered to my colleague , commissioner lamy , for the way he conducted these negotiations .
i have had some experience of negotiating with china myself and i have to say that i am lost in admiration for commissioner lamy 's achievement .
second , i entirely agree with what the honourable member said about the importance of the outcome of these negotiations .
it is good news all round .
it will be a challenge for china and , in due course , for the wto .
however , it has always seemed to me that it is something of a misnomer to talk about a world trade organisation which has not contained the representatives of between a fifth and a quarter of humanity .
this is a good news story .
i want to deal with the two questions which the chairman of the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy has raised .
first , the question about parliament 's assent .
however , at this stage these are just proposals .
we obviously cannot anticipate the results of the igc , so we have to stick to current treaty rules .
as parliament knows , the china agreement does not fit any of the categories of article 300 ( 3 ) that would justify submission for assent .
the agreement will , however , in principle , be submitted for consultation , so the european parliament will have ample opportunity to express its views on the agreement .
of course , it is the council that decides on consultation with the european parliament .
this is as far as the legal and the institutional answer goes .
on a more political and pragmatic level , i can assure the house that the commission will work with the european parliament to ensure that it can make its voice heard .
the house will know that , in exemplary fashion , commissioner lamy has held several rounds of discussions with members of this parliament during the final phases of the negotiations with china .
i know that he debriefed members right after the agreement was initialled : he phoned the honourable member to inform him that he had finalised the agreement .
i can assure the house that he intends to continue this dialogue throughout the internal approval procedures of the european union .
it is an indication of that old truth that being more transparent invariably means being more successful .
at this stage i should like to add , however , that on 19 may we only concluded - a point made by the presidency - our bilateral agreement with china on her terms of accession to the wto .
the multilateral phase of china 's accession that takes place in geneva has still to be finalised .
second , i want to come to the extremely important point which the honourable member raised about technical assistance to help china to implement its wto obligations .
we have in the commission five cooperation programmes in china , which total eur 25 million .
they are either in place or will be implemented soon .
